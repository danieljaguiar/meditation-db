Roman traditions tell that Saint Peter was fleeing, fearfully from the persecution of Nero when he encountered Jesus on the way, with the cross on His back. "*Where are you going, my Lord?*" asks the apostle. "*To Rome*, says Jesus, *to be crucified again*." Peter understood the lesson. He returned, and courageously subjected himself to martyrdom. 

Jesus is still suffering. And until the end of the centuries, on His wounded shoulders, He will carry the enormous weight of our sins. The passion of Jesus continues in the Tabernacle, on the Altar, in the heart of the Church. In the Tabernacle, abandoned; the Altar, desecrated; in the ungrateful children of the Holy Church, in that legion of lukewarm souls, fainthearted in the face of the cross and the persecution of the wicked. And when you flee from suffering, and do not want to fight for God's sake in this painful duty, in this difficult work of apostolate and in the vocation to which you have been called, Jesus presents Himself to you on the path of your life with His cross. And where does He go? To the Calvary of your ungrateful heart, where He will be crucified again. Ask Him like Saint Peter: "Where are You going, Lord?" -- "Quo Vadis?" And that the Lord's response make you, like the Apostle's, return courageously, fight for your eternal salvation and suffer in union with the merits of the Divine Blood shed on the cross!
