HER DESIRE TO HELP US

St. Bernard says that since the power to save us cannot be wanting to Mary as she is the Mother of God, so neither can the desire to help us be wanting because she is our Mother. O Mother of God, and my Mother, Mary, in thee do I place all my confidence.

**I\.** Of what use, says St. Bonaventure, would Mary\'s power be to us if she did not care to help us? But, adds the Saint, let us hold for certain that as the Virgin Mary is the most powerful of all the Saints before God, so she is the most solicitous of all for our salvation. \"And who, O Lady,\" says St. Germanus, \"after thy Son, feels greater solicitude for us than thou dost? Who defends us so powerfully in our afflictions? Who labours so hard for the conversion of sinners? O Mary, thy protection is so great that we cannot comprehend it.\" St. Andrew Avellino used to call Mary \"the agent of Paradise.\" For what does she do in Heaven? She prays continually for us and obtains for us all the graces that we ask. She said one day to St. Bridget: \"I am called, and I truly am, the Mother of Mercy; for such the Mercy of God has made me.\" And who but God in His Mercy, because He wishes to save all, has given us this great protectress? Miserable, and miserable for eternity, said the Blessed Virgin to St. Bridget, shall be the man who is damned, because when it was in his power in this life to invoke my intercession, he neglected to have recourse to me who am so compassionate to all.

Richard of St. Victor says that Mary is so full of mercy that when she sees our miseries she instantly assists us; she cannot behold a soul in want without coming to its relief.

It was thus she acted when she lived on earth as we learn from what happened at the Marriage in Cana of Galilee. If, then, says St. Bonaventure, Mary\'s compassion for the afflicted was so great while she lived in this world, her pity for us is certainly far greater now that she reigns in Heaven where she has a better knowledge of our miseries and greater compassion for our afflictions.

O Lady, if thou pray for me I shall be saved, for thou dost obtain by thy prayers whatever thou wishest. Pray, then, for me, O great Mother of God, for thy Son hears thee and grants whatever thou askest. It is true that I am unworthy of thy protection, but thou hast never abandoned a soul that had recourse to thee. O Mary, I consign my soul to thee. Thou hast to save it.

**II\.** Let us not neglect to have recourse in all our necessities to the Divine Mother who is ever prepared to succour all who invoke her intercession. We shall always find her hands full of mercies and graces. Richard of St. Victor says that Mary\'s heart is so full of compassion, that as soon as she perceives the wants of the miserable, she anticipates their supplications, and obtains relief for them before they ask it. Why, then, says St. Bernard, should we fear that when we have recourse to Mary she will not console us? She is not austere; she does not inspire terror; she is all sweetness and benignity to those who recommend themselves to her. And can she be otherwise than beneficent to those who ask her prayers, when she herself goes in search of the miserable to save them? Behold how she invites all, and encourages them to hope for all good if they have recourse to her: *In me is all hope of life and of virtue: come over to me all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits* (Ecclus. xxiv. 25). On this passage Pelbart says: \"She calls all, the just and sinners.\" The devil, according to St. Peter, *goes about seeking whom he may devour* (1 Peter v. 8), but this Divine Mother, says Bernardine da Bustis, goes about seeking whom she may save.

To obtain salvation through her intercession it is enough to ask the aid of her prayers. St. Bonaventure has written that Mary\'s desire for our welfare and salvation is so great, that she is offended not only with those who do her a positive injury, but also with those who do not ask favours from her. Hence the Saint used to say that when he looked at Mary he beheld Mercy itself stretching out her hands to raise him up from his miseries. For this great Lady knows not, and has never known, how to behold without compassion, or to leave without succour, a person who in his misery recommends himself to her. Mary\'s constant occupation in Heaven consists in asking mercy for the miserable. St. Bridget once heard Jesus say to His holy Mother: \"My Mother, ask what you wish from Me.\" And what was Mary\'s request? \"I ask Mercy for the miserable.\" As if she said: My Son, since Thou hast made me Mother of Mercy and Advocate of the miserable, what else will I ask from Thee but Mercy for those who are in misery? And because poor sinners are the most miserable of all, she has her eyes always turned to them in order to assist them.

O Mary, my Mother, I cannot fear, seeing thy immense mercy and the very great desire of thy most sweet heart to help the most abandoned sinners. And who was ever lost who had recourse to thee? Therefore, I invoke thy aid, O my great advocate, my refuge, my hope, my Mother Mary! Into thy hands I entrust the cause of my eternal salvation. To thee I commit my soul. I implore thee, O Mary, for the love that thou bearest to Jesus, to preserve and increase in me more and more this sweet confidence in thy intercession. Amen.
