In seeking eternal salvation we must, as St. Paul tells us; never rest, but run continually in the way of perfection so that we may win the prize and secure an incorruptible crown_. So run that you may obtain_ -(1 Cor. ix. 24). If we fail, the fault will be all our own, for God wills that all should be holy and perfect. _This is the will of God-your sanctification_-(l Thess. iv. 3).

**I.**

This is the will of God-your sanctification. As it is impossible to arrive at perfection in any art or science without ardent desires of its attainment, so no one has ever yet become a Saint but by strong and fervent aspirations after sanctity. “God,” observes St. Teresa, “ordinarily confers His special favours on those only who thirst after His love.” _Blessed_, says the royal Prophet, _is the man whose help is from thee: in his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps in the vale of tears_, _They shall go from virtue to virtue_-(Ps. lxxxiii. 6, 7, 8). Happy the man who has resolved in his soul to mount the ladder of perfection: he shall receive abundant aid from God, and will ascend from virtue to virtue. Such has been the practice of the Saints, and especially of St. Andrew Avellino, who even bound himself by vow “to advance continually in the way of Christian perfection.” St. Teresa used to say that “God rewards, even in this life, every good desire.” It was by good desires that the Saints arrived in a short time at a sublime degree of sanctity. _Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time_-(Wisd. iv. 13). It was thus that St. Aloysius, who lived but twenty-five years, acquired such perfection that St. Mary Magdalen de Pazzi, who saw him in bliss, declared that his glory appeared equal to that of most of the Saints. In the vision he said to her: My eminent sanctity was the fruit of an ardent desire which I cherished during my life of loving God as much as He deserved to be loved: and, being unable to love Him with that infinite love which: He merits, I suffered on earth a continual martyrdom of love, for which I am now raised to that transcendent glory which I enjoy.

“Our thoughts,” says St. Teresa, “should be aspiring: from great desires all our good will come.” In another place she says: ” We must not lower our desires. but should trust in God that by continual exertion we shall, by His grace, arrive at the sanctity and felicity of the Saints.” Again she says: “The Divine Majesty takes complacency in generous souls who are diffident in themselves.” This great Saint asserted that in all her experience she never knew a timid Christian to attain as much virtue in many years as certain courageous souls acquired in a few days. The reading of the Lives of the Saints contributes greatly to infuse courage into the soul.

It will be particularly useful to read the Lives of those who, after being great sinners, became eminent Saints, such as St. Mary Magdalen, St. Augustine, St. Pelagia, St. Mary of Egypt, and especially St. Margaret of Cortona, who was for many years in a state of damnation, but even then cherished a desire of sanctity; and who, after her conversion, flew to perfection with such rapidity that she merited to learn by revelation, even in this life, not only that she was predestined to glory, but also that a place was reserved for her among the Seraphim.

O Divine Heart of my Jesus! Heart enamoured of men! Heart created to love them! How is it possible that Thou hast been so much dishonoured and despised by them? Unhappy me! I, too, have been one of those ungrateful souls; I, too, have lived so many years in the world and have not loved Thee. Pardon me, O my Jesus, the crime of not having loved Thee, Who art so amiable, and Who hast loved me so much that Thou couldst not have done more than Thou hast done to oblige me to love Thee. In punishment of having so long despised Thy love I would deserve to be condemned to that miserable state in which I could never love Thee. But no, my Jesus; I cheerfully accept every chastisement except the eternal privation of Thy love. Grant me the grace to love Thee, and then dispose of me as Thou pleasest.

**II.**

St. Teresa says that the devil seeks to persuade us that it would be pride in us to desire a high degree of perfection, or to wish to imitate the Saints. She adds that it is a great delusion to regard strong desires of sanctity as the offspring of pride; for it is not pride in a soul diffident of herself and trusting only in the power of God to resolve to walk courageously in the way of perfection, saying with the Apostle: _I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me_-(PhiI. iv. 13). Of myself I can do nothing; but by God’s aid I shall be able to do all things; and therefore I resolve, with His grace, to desire to love Him as the Saints have loved Him.

It is very profitable frequently to aspire after the most exalted virtue, and to desire it–such as to love God more than all the Saints, to suffer for the love of God more than all the Martyrs, to bear and to pardon all injuries, to embrace every sort of fatigue and suffering for the sake of saving a single soul, and to perform similar acts of perfect charity. Because these holy aspirations and desires, though their object will never be attained, are, in the first place, very meritorious in the sight of God, Who glories in men of good will as He abominates a perverse heart and evil inclinations. Secondly, because the habit of aspiring to heroic sanctity animates and encourages the soul to perform acts of ordinary and easy virtue. Hence it is of great importance to propose· in the morning to labour as much as possible for God during the day; to resolve to bear patiently all crosses and contradictions; to observe constant recollection; and to make continual acts of the love of God. Such was the practice of the seraphic St. Francis. “He proposed,” says St. Bonaventure, “with the grace or Jesus Christ to do great things.” St. Teresa asserts that “the Lord is as well pleased with good desires as with their fulfilment.” Oh, how much better is it to serve God than to serve the world! To acquire goods of the earth, to procure wealth, honours, and applause of men, it is not enough to pant after them with ardour; no, to desire and not to obtain them only renders their absence more painful. But to merit the riches and the favour of God, it is sufficient to desire His grace and love.

O my Jesus, Thou sayest: _Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart_-(Matt. xxii. 37). It is Thy will, then, that I love Thee with my whole soul, and I desire nothing but to love Thee with all my strength. O loving Heart of my Jesus, light up in my soul that blessed fire which Thou camest on earth to enkindle. Destroy all the earthly attachments that still live in my heart, and prevent me from belonging entirely to Thee. O my beloved Saviour, do not reject the love of a heart which has hitherto so much afflicted Thee. Ah, since Thou hast loved me so much, do not permit me to live for a single moment without Thy love! O love of my Jesus, Thou art my love! I hope that I shall always love Thee, and that Thou wilt always love me; and that this mutual love shall never be dissolved.

O Mary, Mother of fair love, O thou who dost desire to see thy Son loved, bind and unite me to Jesus, so that I may become entirely His, as He desires me to be.
