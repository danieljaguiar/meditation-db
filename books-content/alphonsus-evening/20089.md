St. Bernardine says that the most celebrated of all counsels, and the one which is, as it were, the very foundation of Religion, is to flee the occasions of sin. Being compelled by Exorcisms, the devil once confessed that of all sermons, that which displeased him most was the sermon *on avoiding the occasions of sin*: and justly so, for the devil laughs at all the resolutions and promises of penitent sinners who remain in the occasion of sin. The occasion of sins of the flesh, in particular, is like a veil placed before the eyes which prevents the soul from seeing either its resolutions, or the lights received from God, or the truths of eternity. In a word, it makes it forget everything, and almost blinds it. The neglect of avoiding the occasions of sin was the cause of the fall of our first parents. God had forbidden them even to touch the forbidden fruit. *God commanded us*, said Eve, *that we should not eat, and that we should not touch it* (Gen. iii. 3). But through want of caution she *saw*, *took*, and *ate it*. She first began to look at the apple, she afterwards took it in her hand, and then ate it. He who voluntarily exposes himself to danger, will perish in it. *He that loveth danger shall perish in it* (Ecclus. iii. 27). St. Peter tells us that the devil *goeth about seeking whom he may devour* (1 Peter v. 8). And what, says St. Cyprian, does he do in order to enter again into the soul from which he has been expelled? He seeks an occasion of sin. If the soul permits him to bring it again into the occasion of sin, he will enter again and devour it. The Abbot Guerric says that Lazarus came forth from the grave bound hand and foot, and after rising in this state he died again. He means to say, that miserable is the man who rises from sin bound by the occasion of sin. Though he should rise, he will surely fall again. He, then, who wishes to be saved must forsake not only all *sin*, but the *occasions of sin* — that is, the companions, the house, the connections which lead to sin.

But you will say: I have changed my life, and now I have no bad motive, nor even a temptation in the society of such a person. It is related that in Mauritania there are bears that go in search of monkeys. As soon as they see a bear, the monkeys save themselves by climbing the trees: but what does the bear do? He stretches himself, as if dead, under the tree; and when the monkeys descend, he springs up, seizes, and devours them. It is thus the devil acts: he makes the temptations appear as dead; and when the soul exposes itself to the occasions of sin, he excites the temptation which devours it. Oh! how many miserable souls, that practised Mental Prayer and frequent Communion, and might be called Saints, have, by putting themselves into dangerous occasions, become the prey of hell! It is related in Ecclesiastical history, that a holy matron, who devoted herself to the pious work of burying the Martyrs, found one of them alive. She brought him to her house: he recovered. What happened? By the proximate occasion, these two Saints, as they might be called, first lost the grace of God, and afterwards lost the Faith.

My dear Redeemer, I thank Thee for the light which Thou now givest me, and for the means of salvation Thou makest known to me. I promise to endeavour to persevere in the practice of them. I see that Thou wishest my salvation; and I wish to be saved principally to please Thy Heart, which so ardently desires my salvation. O my God, I will no longer resist the love Thou entertainest for me. This love has made Thee bear with me so patiently when I offended Thee. Thou callest me to Thy love, and I desire only to love Thee. I love Thee, O infinite Goodness: I love Thee, O infinite Good.

The Lord commanded Isaias to proclaim that *all flesh is grass* (Is. xl. 6). Is it possible, asks St. John Chrysostom, for hay not to burn when it is thrown into the fire? And St. Cyprian says that it is impossible to stand in the midst of the flames and not be burned. According to the Prophet Isaias, our strength is like that of tow cast into the fire. *And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow* (Is. i. 31). And Solomon says: *Can a man walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?* (Prov. vi. 27). Thus it is likewise folly to expose ourselves to the occasion of sin, and to expect not to fall. It is necessary then to fly from sin as from the face of a serpent. *Flee from sins as from the face of a serpent* (Ecclus. xxi. 2). We ought not only to avoid the bite or contact of a serpent, but should also keep from approaching it. But you will say: My interest requires that I should frequent such a house, or that I should keep up a certain friendship. But if you see that such a house is for you a way to hell, there is no remedy; you must forsake it if you wish to save your soul. *Her house is the way to hell* (Prov. vii. 27). The Lord tells you that if your right eye is a cause of damnation to you, you must *pluck it out and cast it from you* (Matt. v. 29). Mark the words: you must *cast it*, not *beside* you, but *from* you — that is, you must take away every occasion of sin. St. Francis of Assisi says, that the devil tempts spiritual souls who have given themselves to God, in a way different from that in which he tempts the wicked. In the beginning he does not seek to bind them with a chain; he is content to hold them by a single hair: he then binds them with a slender thread; afterwards with a cord; then with a chain; and thus drags them to sin. And therefore he who wishes to be free from the danger of perdition must from the beginning break all these hairs; he must avoid all occasions of sins; he must give up these salutations, presents, letters, and the like. And for those who have contracted a habit of committing sins against purity, it will not be enough to avoid *proximate occasions*: unless they fly even from *remote occasions*, they will relapse.

He who sincerely wishes to be saved, must often repeat with the Saints: *Let all be lost, provided God is not lost*, so as continually to strengthen and renew his resolution of never again renouncing the friendship of God.

Ah! I entreat Thee, O my God, through the merits of Jesus Christ, not to permit me to be ever again ungrateful to Thee, and, either to make me cease to be ungrateful to Thee, or to make me cease to live. Lord, Thou hast already begun the work; bring it to perfection. *Confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us* (Ps. lxvii. 29). Give me light, give me strength, give me love. O Mary, thou who art the treasurer of graces, assist me: accept me for thy servant and pray to Jesus for me. Through the merits of Jesus Christ, first, and then through thy prayers, I hope for salvation.
