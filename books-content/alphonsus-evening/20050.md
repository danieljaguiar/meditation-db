**I\.** *My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up* (Cant. iv. 12).

Since it was becoming that the Eternal Father should preserve Mary from sin as His daughter, and the Son as His Mother, it was also becoming that the Holy Ghost should preserve her as His Spouse. St. Augustine says that \"Mary was that only one who merited to be called the Mother and Spouse of God.\" For St. Anselm asserts that the Divine Spirit, the Love itself of the Father and the Son, came corporally into Mary, and enriching her with singular grace above all creatures, rested in her and made her the Queen of Heaven and earth. *The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee* (Luke i. 35).

And now, had an excellent artist the power to make his bride in reality such as he would represent her in his picture, what pains would he not take to render her as beautiful as possible! Who, then, can say that the Holy Ghost did otherwise with Mary, when He could make her, who was to be His Spouse, as beautiful as it was becoming that she should be? Ah no, the Holy Ghost acted as it became Him to act, for this same Lord declares: *Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee* (Cant. iv. 7).

The Holy Ghost signifies the same thing when He called this His Spouse an enclosed garden and a sealed fountain: *My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up* â€” a Spouse into whom no guile could enter, against whom no fraud of the enemy could prevail, and who was always holy in mind and body. \"Thou art,\" says St. Bernard, \"an enclosed garden into which has never entered the hand of sinners to pluck its flowers.\"

Ah, my immaculate Queen, fair dove, beloved of God, disdain not to cast thine eyes on the many stains and wounds of my soul. See me and pity me. God Who loves thee much, denies thee nothing, and thou knowest not how to refuse those who have recourse to thee. O Mary conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee.

**II\.** In Proverbs we read: *Many daughters have gathered together riches, thou hast surpassed them all* (Prov. xxxi. 29). If Mary has surpassed all others in the riches of grace, she must have had original justice as Adam and the Angels had it. In the Canticles we read: *There are young maidens without number. One is my dove, my perfect one* (in the Hebrew it is *my entire, my immaculate one) is but one. She is the only one of her mother* (Cant. vi. 7). All souls are daughters of divine grace, but amongst these Mary was the *dove* without the gall of sin, the *perfect one* without spot in her origin, the *one* conceived in grace.

Hence it is that the Angel, before she became the Mother of God, found her already *full of grace*, and saluted her: *Hail, full of grace!* (Luke i. 28). Grace was given partially to other Saints, but to the Blessed Virgin all grace was given. So much so that St. Thomas says: \"Grace rendered not only the soul but even the flesh of Mary holy, so that the Blessed Virgin might be able to clothe the Eternal Word with it.\"

O immaculate and entirely pure Virgin Mary, Mother of God, Queen of the Universe, our own good Lady, thou art the advocate of sinners, the consolation of the world, the ransom of captives, the joy of the sick, the comfort of the afflicted, the refuge and salvation of the whole world. O most pure Virgin Mary, I venerate thy most holy heart which was the delight and resting-place of God, thy heart overflowing with humility, purity and divine love. Ah, my Mother, for the love of Jesus, take charge of my salvation. O Lady, deny not thy compassion to one to whom Jesus has not denied His Blood. O my Mother, abandon me not! Never, never cease to pray for me until thou seest me safe in Heaven at thy feet, blessing and thanking thee for ever. Amen.
