# Presence of God

O God, who hast loved me from all eternity and always lovest me in a disinterested way, teach me to love without calculation or measure.

**I.** Charity "seeketh not her own" ([1Co. 13, 5](https://vulgata.online/bible/1Co.13?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.1Co.13.5:vs)). Attention to the needs and sorrows of others, with a constant readiness to give one’s help, is no justification for expecting a like return. "Do good, and lend,hoping for nothing thereby; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest; for He is kind to the unthankful and to the evil" ([Lc. 6, 35](https://vulgata.online/bible/Lc.6?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Lc.6.35:vs)). Charity does not give in order to receive; it gives without counting the cost and without measure, for it knows that the honor of serving and loving God in His creatures is ample reward. Charity loves, serves, gives, and spends itself lavishly, solely for the sake of loving and serving God in others, for the joy of imitating His infinite generosity, for the joy offeeling itself the childof the heavenly Father who bestows His favors upon all without distinction. What greater reward can there be than to be able to call ourselves, and to be in all truth, children of God! To enjoy this reward, charity seeks to fly from every earthly recompense and hides the good it does. "Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth" ([Mt. 6, 3](https://vulgata.online/bible/Mt.6?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Mt.6.3:vs)). It seeks by preference to benefit those from whom it can expect nothing in return : "When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren. . . lest perhaps they also invite thee again and a recompense be made to thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind; and thou shalt be blessed, because they have not wherewith to make thee recompense" ([Lc. 14, 12-14](https://vulgata.online/bible/Lc.14?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Lc.14.12-14:vs)). How the logic of the Gospel differs from the logic of human calculations!

Whenever a strong desire to give ourselves to God arises in our heart, it is accompanied by a similar longing to give ourselves to others solely for love of God. Then we no longer distinguish between serving God and serving others : we see God in everyone, we give ourselves to them in order to give ourselves to God, and we give ourselves to all as we would give ourselves to God. This was the attitude in the heart of St. Paul when he exclaimed : "But I most gladly will spend and be spent myselffor your souls, although loving you more, I be loved less" ([1Co. 12, 15](https://vulgata.online/bible/1Co.12?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.1Co.12.15:vs)).

**II.** "Charity is patient, is kind. . .is not provoked to anger" ([1Co. 13, 4-5](https://vulgata.online/bible/1Co.13?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.1Co.13.4-5:vs)). Charity is never wearied, is never impatient with the ungrateful, is not irritated when repulsed, but perseveres in loving and doing good. Charity does not look for gratitude, is not ungracious. It is not offended when it meets with a lack of refinement or consideration; but, in spite of the coldness and hostility which it may encounter, it continues its one work : to give itself, and to give itself always, for the love of God. At the same time, however, charity is not insensible to ingratitude and offenses; on the contrary, the more a heart is refined in love, the more sensitive it is to everything which is opposed to love.

But it does not make use of its sensitiveness to defend its own rights, to protest against the ingratitude of others, or to demand some degree of justice; it sacrifices all these to God for the benefit of those who have caused its suffering. This is the characteristic of charity : it does not permit itself to be "overcome by evil," but it "overcomes evil by good" ([Rm. 12, 21](https://vulgata.online/bible/Rm.12?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Rm.12.21:vs)).

We all know, however, how difficult this is, how hard for selfish, demanding nature. Sometimes, just when one is about to perform an especially delicate act of charity for another, a strong feeling of antipathy toward that person arises from the sensitive part of the soul because of the absence of some sign or token of respect or consideration. This is manifestly a temptation which must be overcome as soon as it appears, that it may not take root. Anyone who would yield to these feelings and act accordingly, under the pretext ofjustice or of teaching a lesson, would soon become very exacting to the great detriment of charity. In community life especially, patient charity must be practiced, the charity which knows how to pass over wrongs, little or great, misunderstandings and offenses; one which knows how to accept calmly every pinprick, without even appearing to feel it or trying to show others that they have hurt us.

With the help of God’s grace and by struggling against the resentments of self-love, we shall attain to that charity which is completely forgetful ofself; then we shall be good to those around us, "not justices of the peace, but angels of peace" (T.C.J. C).

# Colloquy

"O eternal God, the soul who truly loves You spends itself for its neighbor and cannot do otherwise, for its love for You and its love of neighbor are one and the same thing; the more the soul loves You, the more it loves its neighbor, because love of neighbor has its source in You.

"You have given us this means of proving and practicing virtue, O Most High God, so that, since we cannot benefit You, we can benefit others. Therefore, a soul in love with You, most amiable Lord, never ceases to spend itself in doing good to others, striving to discover their needs and hastening to help them.

"O God, eternal Trinity, You ask us to love You with the same love with which You love us. This we cannot do, for You loved us when we were as yet Your enemies; and however great our love for You, we would always owe You this love, as due to You; it is therefore, not gratuitous, because You loved us first. As it is impossible for us to give You the love You desire, You have given us our neighbor, that we may do for him what we cannot do for You, that is, love him without having been loved by him—gratuitously—without expecting any benefit from it.

"Teach me, O Lord, to love my neighbor even when not loved by him, to love him with no concern for my own benefit, but solely because You love me, solely to repay Your gratuitous love. Then I shall fulfill the commandment of the law : to love You above all things, and my neighbor as myself" (cf. St. Catherine of Siena).
