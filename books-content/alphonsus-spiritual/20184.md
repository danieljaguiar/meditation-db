XXVI.-” CHARITY IS PATIENT.”-THE SOUL THAT LOVES JESUS CHRIST LOVES TO SUFFER

**I.**

A soul that loves God has no other end in view than to be wholly united with Him; but let us learn from St. Catherine of Genoa what is necessary to be done to arrive at this perfect union: “To attain union with God, adversities are indispensable,” she says, “because by them God aims at destroying all our corrupt propensities within and without. And hence all injuries, contempt, infirmities, abandonment by relations and friends, Confusion, temptations, and other mortifications-all are in the highest degree necessary for us in order that we may carry on the fight until by repeated victories we come to extinguish within us all vicious movements, so that they are no longer felt; and we shall never arrive at Divine union until adversities, instead of seeming bitter to us, become all sweet for God’s sake.”

**II.**

It follows, then, that a soul that sincerely desires to belong to God must be resolved, as St. John of the Cross writes, not to seek enjoyments in this life, but to suffer in all things; she must embrace with eagerness all voluntary mortifications, and with still greater eagerness those which are involuntary, since they are the more welcome to Almighty God: “The patient man is better than the valiant.” God is pleased with a person who practises mortification by fasting, cilices, and disciplines, on account of the courage displayed in such mortifications; but He is much more pleased with those who have the courage to bear patiently and gladly such crosses as come from His own Divine hand. St. Francis de Sales said: “Such mortifications as come to us from the hand of God, or from men by His permission, are always more precious than those which are the offspring of our own will; for it is a general rule that wherever there is less of our own choice, God is better pleased, and we ourselves derive greater profit.” St. Teresa taught the same thing: “We gain more in one day by the oppositions which come to us from God or from our neighbour than by ten years of mortification self-inflicted.”
