One day, when Alphonsus was conversing with a bishop with whom he was very intimate, he remarked that one of the greatest graces he had ever received was that of having escaped the peril of being a bishop: \"a peril,\" he added, \"that I should have had some difficulty in avoiding, had I remained with my family.\" Strange to relate, almost at the same moment, when the holy man was congratulating himself on his happy escape from this perilous dignity, steps were being taken both at Naples and at Rome for imposing this burden upon him. Very shortly after the conversation above related, a courier from Naples arrived at Nocera, bearing letters for Alphonsus from the Apostolic Nuncio, announcing his election by the Sovereign Pontiff to the Bishopric of St. Agatha of the Goths, which had lately become vacant. On reading the letters Alphonsus was thunderstruck, and could not speak. The news spread quickly through the house; his sons hastened to his room and found him silent, agitated, and bathed in tears. Soon, however, he became calm, feeling sure that his refusal would end the matter, and that his election was merely a mark of esteem which the Pope wished to confer upon him. The others were of the same opinion. \"Do not be troubled,\" said Father Ferrara, \"the refusal of such dignities is readily accepted.\" Alphonsus remembered, too, how his simple refusal of the archbishopric of Palermo had been sufficient to prevent any further importunities.

His mind being now more at ease he wrote off at once to Rome, to thank the Sovereign Pontiff for his gracious intentions, but at the same time to excuse himself from accepting the episcopal dignity. He enlarged upon his own incapacity, his great age, his habitual infirmities, the vow he had made never to accept any dignity, and the scandal his acceptance would give to the members of the Congregation. When the messenger had gone, he turned round to those of his sons who were present, and said: \"This storm has cost me an hour and four ducats. I would not exchange my Congregation for all the kingdoms of the world.\" In order the more surely to avert this dreadful burden, Alphonsus multiplied his accustomed prayers and mortifications; and not content with his own fasts, disciplines, and vigils, he implored the intercession of the members of his Congregation, and of many pious souls whose prayers he knew were acceptable to Jesus Christ and His Virgin Mother. At the same time he wrote to various persons in authority begging them to use their influence in his behalf. In one word, he left nothing untried to allay what he called this terrible tempest. But the tempest could not be allayed, and soon letters arrived from Rome confirming in the most absolute manner the election of Alphonsus.

Everyone was well aware of the shock which this news would cause the venerable old man, and therefore two of the members of his Congregation undertook the unwelcome office of conveying to him the decision of the Pontiff. They entered the room of Alphonsus, and begged him to kneel and say a \"Hail Mary.\" Having recited it, he enquired in an agitated manner whether the messenger had arrived. \"Yes,\" said the Father, \"and the Sovereign Pontiff commands you to undertake the episcopal office.\" At these words he was silent, and then, having raised his eyes to Heaven, he bent his head in token of submission, exclaiming: \"I have nothing to reply, since it is Thou, Lord, Who hast done this. Yes, Lord, I am dumb, because Thou hast done it.\" Then, after a moment\'s recollection, he added, with tears: \"It is the will of God. He drives me out of the Congregation for my sins. Do not forget me, my brothers, do not forget me. Must we then separate after having loved each other so tenderly for thirty years?\" Having said this, he became speechless from grief, whilst torrents of tears flowed from his eyes. The Fathers tried to console him by saying that some of his friends would yet succeed in inducing the Pope to accept his renunciation. \"No,\" said Alphonsus, \"the Pontiff\'s words admit of no interpretation. He has declared his will in a manner that demands obedience. I must obey.\"

Alphonsus did, in fact, obey, but the effort which it cost him was so great as almost to cause his death. He was seized with a violent fever, and soon it was reported both at Naples and at Rome, that he was actually dead. But God restored him to health; and as soon as he felt himself convalescent, he determined to set out at once for Rome. On his arrival there he found that the Pope was then absent from the Eternal City, so he determined to visit Loretto. After he had satisfied his devotion to the Incarnate Word and His Virgin Mother at this sacred shrine, he returned to Rome, and was consecrated Bishop in the Church of the Minerva. Then having received the Apostolic Benediction from Clement XIII, he set out with all haste for his diocese, where he was received with joy by his new flock, as a pastor and father sent to them by God Himself. These events took place in the year 1762.

Having now taken possession of his diocese, he applied himself to fulfil as perfectly as possible, the various duties of his high office. From the very commencement it was easy to see that his flock would find in him a model of all virtues, and that in his life and actions would be realised the idea of a true bishop. During the thirteen years in which he occupied the See of St. Agatha his energies were specially directed to three objects: his own diocese, his Congregation, and the Universal Church. He spared no labours in his attempts to sanctify the first; of the second he still retained the government, with the assistance of a vicar-general; and the third was always the object of his pious solicitude. We will now say a few words on these points.

To begin with his pastoral duties, the first thought of the holy bishop was the proper regulation of his own household. The following is the rule of life which he marked out for himself. As soon as he had risen he gave himself the discipline, and this penitential exercise was followed by meditation, which he made in common with the members of his household. Then he recited the \"Little Hours,\" and after a long preparation celebrated the Holy Sacrifice, and heard another Mass afterwards as thanksgiving. He next gave audience to all who desired it, but was careful not to allow any useless conversations. If any spare time was left him, he employed it in prayer or study. After dinner he took the usual repose, although it was a very short one. He then returned to the studies which he had interrupted, or applied himself to the transaction of necessary business, or to prayer, and thus remained occupied until a late hour of the night. He assisted every evening at the visit to the Blessed Sacrament in the church. Everything in his palace was of the plainest and simplest kind. All that savoured of luxury was so rigidly excluded from his table that it would be difficult to imagine a more austere mode of life. He had as few servants as possible, and over those he watched with the greatest vigilance. They were forbidden to enter a tavern, or to indulge in gaming. Every day they had to be present at the Holy Mass, and twice a month approach the Sacraments, for he wished that their lives should be irreproachable, and give edification to all.
