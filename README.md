# Texts for Meditation Site

This is a public repository for meditations in [https://meditatione.online/](https://meditatione.online/)

Files are in the markdown format, we are specifically using the [commonmark](https://commonmark.org/) .

- [_Index](https://github.com/danieljaguiar/meditation-db/tree/main/_index) is the lists I use
- [_Scripts](https://github.com/danieljaguiar/meditation-db/tree/main/_scripts) are the Python scripts that I run to modify content where I am confident that it will not break things
- Other folders the actual content
