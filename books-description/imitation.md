The Imitation of Christ, is a Catholic devotional book written around 1420, with emphasis in the interior life and withdrawal from the mundanities of the world. It is considered the most read book in the Christianhood after the Bible.
 
Many Saints profited from its reading. 

Saint Francis de Sales, recommends this book for meditation in his Introduction to Devout Life (Filoteia), as well as Dom Chautard in "The Soul of All Apostolate". 

Saint Therese of Liseux tells us (in History of a Soul) that "for many years" this was the only book she was able to get spiritual progress. It is also known that Saint Thomas More and Saint Ignatius of Loyola read this book frequently.
 
It is definitely an excellent book for meditation.
