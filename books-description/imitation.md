The Imitation of Christ, is a Catholic devotional book written around 1420, with emphasises in the interior life and withdrawal from the mundanities of the world. It is considered the most read book in the Christanhood after the Bible.

Many Saints profited from its reading. Saint Francis de Sales, recommends this book for meditation in his Introduction to Devout Life (Filoteia). Saint Therese of Liseux tell us (in History of a Soul) that "for many years" this was the only book she was able to get spiritual progress.

It defenetly an excellent book for meditation.
