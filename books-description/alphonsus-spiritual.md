The original title of this book is "Meditations and Readings for every day of the year from the writings of St. Alphonsus" in 4 Volumes, each volume composed by 2 books. The 8 books together have over 1200 pages.

First book was published in 1923 by Father John Baptiste Coyle C.SS.R. . Who worked for many years to organize and publish the writings of this great doctor of the church.

> It was a labour of many years but, needless to say, a labour of love.

Every day father Coyle proposes 3 readings:

1. Morning Meditation
2. Evening Meditation
3. Spiritual Reading

In this digital form, we decided to make the 3 types of readings as if they were 3 different books, since the subject of the Morning Meditation of one day, is continued in the Morning Meditation of the next day. The same happens for Evening Meditation and Spiritual Reading.
