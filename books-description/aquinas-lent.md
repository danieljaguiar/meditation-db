Published in Latin under the name *"Medulla S. Thomae Aquinatis : per omnes anni liturgici dies distributa seu meditationes ex operibus S. Thomae depromptae"* (*[WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/title/medulla-s-thomae-aquinatis-per-omnes-anni-liturgici-dies-distributa-seu-meditationes-ex-operibus-s-thomae-depromptae/oclc/757887571)*) by father Dennis Mez√°rd. It is a colletion of writings from Saint Thomas Aquinas, neatly organized to be read and meditate during the tridentine liturgical year.

As it is expected in the texts from the great Saint Thomas Aquinas, the meditations are from a higher theological and philosophical order, exploring a doctrinal perspective of the meditation where one can ponder for hours the implications of such precise explanations as the Saint usually does.

The readings often remind us of the liturgical text of the day. Meditating on the on this work in the morning, before attending daily Mass, is of great spiritual value.
