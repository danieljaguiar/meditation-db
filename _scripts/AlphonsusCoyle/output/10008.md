*What things soever were written were written for our learning, that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.* (Epistle of Sunday. Rom. xv. 4-13).

In tribulations God enriches His beloved souls with the greatest graces. It is *in his chains* that St. John comes to the knowledge of the works of Jesus Christ. *Let us believe that these scourges of the Lord, with which we are chastised have happened for our amendment and not for our destruction* (Judith, viii. 27).

By tribulation we atone for the sins we have committed much better than by voluntary works of penance. \"Be assured,\" says St. Augustine, \"that God is a physician, and that tribulation is a salutary medicine.\" Oh, how great is the efficacy of tribulation in healing the wounds caused by our sins! Hence the same Saint rebukes the sinner who complains of God for sending him tribulations. \"Why,\" he says, \"do you complain? What you suffer is a remedy, not a punishment.\" Job called those men happy whom God corrects by tribulation; because He heals them with the very hands by which He strikes and wounds them. *Blessed is the man whom God correcteth\... For he woundeth and cureth. He striketh, and his hand shall heal* (Job v. 17). Hence, St. Paul gloried in his tribulations: *We glory also in tribulations* (Rom. v. 3).

Tribulations enable us to acquire great merits before God, by giving us opportunities of exercising the virtues of humility, of patience, and of resignation to the divine will. The Blessed John of Avila used to say that one *Blessed be God* in adversity is worth more than a thousand in prosperity. \"Take away,\" says St. Ambrose, \"the contests of the Martyrs, and you have taken away their crowns.\" Oh, what a treasure of merit is acquired by patiently bearing insults, poverty, and sickness! Insults from men were the great object of the desires of the Saints, who sought to be despised for the love of Jesus Christ, and thus to be made like unto Him.

My Jesus, I have hitherto offended Thee grievously by resisting Thy holy Will. This gives me greater pain than if I had suffered every other evil. I repent of it and I am sorry for it with my whole heart. I deserve chastisement: I do not refuse it: I accept it. Preserve me only from the chastisement of being deprived of Thy love, and then do with me what Thou pleasest. I love Thee, my dear Redeemer! I love Thee, my God! And because I love Thee, I wish to do whatever Thou wishest. Amen.

St. Francis de Sales used to say: \"To suffer constantly for Jesus is the science of the Saints; we shall thus soon become Saints.\" It is by sufferings that God proves His servants, and finds them worthy of Himself. *God hath tried them and found them worthy of himself* (Wis. iii. 5). *Whom*, says St. Paul, *the Lord loveth he chastiseth; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth* (Heb. xii. 6). Hence, Jesus Christ once said to St. Teresa: \"Be assured that the souls dearest to My Father are those who suffer the greatest afflictions.\" Hence Job said: *If we have received good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil?* (Job ii. 10). If we have gladly received from God the goods of this earth, why should we not receive more cheerfully tribulations, which are far more useful to us than worldly prosperity? St. Gregory informs us that, as a flame fanned by the wind increases, so the soul is made perfect when she is oppressed by tribulations.

In fine, the scourges of Heaven are sent, not for our injury, but for our good. *Let us believe that these scourges of the Lord, with which, like servants, we are chastised, have happened for our amendment and not for our destruction* (Judith, viii. 27). \"God,\" says St. Augustine, \"is angry when He does not scourge the sinner.\" When we see a sinner in tribulation in this life, we may infer that God wishes to have mercy on him in the next, and that he exchanges eternal for temporal chastisement. But miserable the sinner whom the Lord does not punish in this life! For those whom He does not chastise here, He treasures up His wrath, and for them He reserves eternal chastisement.

O Will of God, Thou art my love! O Blood of Jesus, Thou art my hope! I hope to be from this day forward always united to Thy Divine Will. It shall be my guide, my desire, my love, my hope. *Thy Will be done!* My Jesus, through Thy merits grant me the grace always to repeat: *Thy Will be done! Thy Will be done!*

Ah, my blessed Mother Mary, thou hast been pleased to suffer so much for me, obtain for me, by thy merits, sorrow for my sins, and patience under the trials of life which will always be light in comparison with my demerits for I have often deserved hell. Immaculate Virgin, from thee do I hope for help to bear all crosses with patience. Amen.
