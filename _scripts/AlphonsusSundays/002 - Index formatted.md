### OBJECT OF THE WORK.


### 


THE present Work is entitled, ABRIDGED SERMONS FOR ALL THE SUNDAYS IN THE
YEAR. They are called Abridged Sermons, because, although each contains abundant matter
for a sermon, the sentiments are briefly expressed not, however, so briefly as to render the
sense obscure. Hence the work may be used for spiritual lectures. Diffuseness has been
purposely avoided, that the preacher may extend the subject treated in the way which may
appear best to him. A preacher will scarce ever deliver, with zeal and warmth, sentiments
which he has not made in some manner his own. Hence the matter of each sermon has been
condensed into a small compass, that the preacher may extend it according to his pleasure,
and thus make it his own.


In each sermon there are many passages from the Scriptures and Holy Fathers, and a variety
of reflections perhaps too many for a single discourse that the reader may select what will be
most pleasing to him. The style is easy and simple, and therefore calculated to render the
preaching of the Divine Word conducive to the salvation of souls.


**PROTESTATION.**
IN obedience to the decrees of Urban VIII., I protest that, of the miraculous works and gifts
ascribed in this work to certain servants of God, and not already approved by the Holy See, I
claim no other belief than that which is ordinarily given to history resting on mere human
authority; and that in bestowing the title of Saint or Blessed, on any person not canonized or
beatified by the Church, I only intend to do it according to the usage and opinion of men.


**INSTRUCTIONS TO PREACHERS.**



1. IN the first place, the preacher, if he wishes that his preaching shall produce abundant
fruit, should propose to himself the proper end that is, to preach, not with a view to obtain
honour, or applause, or any temporal advantage, but solely to gain souls to God; and hence it
is necessary, that when he enters upon his exalted office of divine ambassador, he should



pray to God fervently to inflame his heart with his holy love; because it is by this means that
his preaching will be productive of much fruit. The venerable Father John D’Avila being once
asked, what was most conducive to wards preaching well, replied in those short but
expressive words" To love Jesus Christ well" It has been therefore found by experience, that
preachers who love Jesus Christ have often effected more by a single discourse, than others
by several.



2. St. Thomas of Villanova said, that the words of a sermon should be like so many darts of
fire, which would wound and inflame the hearers with divine love**_. ”But how,"_** he subjoined,
” **_can the heart be set on fire by those sermons which, though long and elaborate, issue,
notwithstanding, from a frozen heart?”_** St. Francis de Sales observes, that the tongue speaks
to the ear, but the heart speaks to the heart. He proceeds to say, **_that when the sentiments do
not spring from the heart of the preacher, it is with difficulty they draw the hearts of others
to divine love; he must himself be first inflamed with it. ”Lampades ejus lampades ignis,
atque flammarum."_** (Cant. viii. 6.) He must be first a fire to burn, and afterwards a flame to
set others on fire. St. Bernard explained this in other terms, when he said, that he must be
first a cistern, and then a canal; first a cistern that is, full of the fervour and zeal which are
collected in mental prayer; and then a canal, to communicate it to others.


3. With regard to the subject matter of sermons. Those subjects should be selected which
move most powerfully to detest sin and to love God; whence the preacher should often speak
of the last things of death, of judgment, of Hell, of Heaven, and of eternity. According to the
advice of the Holy Spirit, ”Memorare novissima tua, et in æternum non peccabis," (Eccl. vii.
40,) it is particularly useful often to make mention of death, by delivering several discourses
on that subject during the year, speaking at one time on the uncertainty of death, which
terminates all the pleasures as well as all the afflictions of this life; at another, on the
uncertainty of the time at which death may arrive; now, on the unhappy death of the sinner;
and again, on the happy death of the just.


4. The preacher should often speak of the love which Jesus Christ bears towards us, of the
love which we should bear to Jesus Christ, and of the confidence we should have in his
mercy whenever we are resolved to amend our lives. It would appear that some preachers do
not know how to speak of anything but the justice of God, terrors, threats, and chastisements.
There is no doubt but that terrifying discourses are of use to arouse sinners from the sleep of
sin; but we should be persuaded at the same time, that those who abstain from sin solely
through the fear of punishment, will with difficulty persevere for a long time. Love is that
golden link which binds the soul to God, and makes it faithful in repelling temptation and
practising virtue. St. Augustine said: "Ama et fac quod vis." He who truly loves God, flies
from everything displeasing to Him, and seeks to please Him to the utmost of his power.
And here let us cite that remarkable saying of St. Francis de Sales: ”The love that does not
spring from the passion of Christ is weak." By this the saint gives us to understand that the
passion of Christ moves us most effectually to love him.


5. Thus it is very useful, and most conducive to inspire the love of God, to speak to sinners of
the confidence which we should have in Jesus Christ if we abandon sin. ”Viam mandatorum,
tuorum cucurri, cum dilatasti cor meum" (Ps, cxviii. 32.) **_When the heart is dilated with
confidence it easily runs in the way of the Lord._** In like manner the preacher should often



speak of the confidence which we should have in the intercession of the Mother of God.
Besides the discourses delivered during the course of the year, on the principal festivals of
the Blessed Virgin Mary as the Annunciation, the Assumption, her Patronage, and her
Dolours let him oftentimes, in his addresses to the people, inculcate upon the minds of his
auditors devotion to the Mother of God. Some preachers have a very laudable custom of
introducing into every sermon some thing regarding the Blessed Virgin, either by relating
some example of graces bestowed on her clients, or of some act of homage performed by her
votaries, or some prayer which we should offer to her.



6. Moreover, the preacher should often speak of the means by which we are preserved in the
grace of God: such as, flying dangerous occasions and wicked companions, frequenting the
sacraments, and especially recommending ourselves often to God and the Virgin Mother, in
order to obtain the graces necessary for salvation, and principally the graces of perseverance
and of the love of Jesus Christ, without which we cannot be saved.


7. The preacher should likewise often speak against bad confessions, in which sins are
concealed through shame. This is an evil not of rare occurrence, but frequent, especially in
small country districts, which consigns innumerable souls to hell. Hence it is very useful to
mention, from time to time, some example of souls that were damned by willfully concealing
sins in confession.


8. We shall now speak briefly of the parts of a discourse, which are nine: the exordium, the
proposition, the division, the introduction, the proof, the confutation, the amplification, the
peroration or conclusion, the epilogue, and the appeal to the passions. These are again
reduced to three principal divisions: 1 the exordium; 2 the proof, which comprises the
introduction that precedes, and the confutation of the opposite arguments, that follows it; 3
the peroration or conclusion, which comprises the epilogue, the moral exhortation, and the
appeal to the passions. To the exordium rhetoricians assign seven parts: the introduction,
general proposition, confirmation, repetition of the proposition, connection, particular
proposition, and division. But, commonly speaking, the substantial parts of the exordium are
three: 1 the general proposition; 2 the connection or the link by which it is connected with the
particular proposition; 3 the particular proposition, or the principal one of the discourse,
which includes the division of the points. For example: 1 ”We must work out our salvation,
because there is no alternative: whosoever is not saved is damned: ”that is the general
proposition. 2”But, to be saved, we must die a happy death: that is the connection or
application. 3”But it is exceedingly difficult to die a happy death after a wicked life:" and that
is the particular proposition, or principal one of the discourse, which ought to be clear,
concise, and, simple, and, at the same time, one; otherwise, if unity be not observed in the
proposition, it would not be one sermon, but several; and, therefore, the points into which the
discourse is divided ought all tend to prove one single proposition. For example: "The person
who is addicted to a bad habit is with difficulty saved, because the bad habit (1) darkens the
understanding, (2) hardens the heart :" and these will be the two points of the discourse. Let
the points be short and few, not exceeding two, or, at most, three; and sometimes a single
point will be sufficient. For example: “Mortal sin is a great evil, because it is an injury done to
God ;" or, ”He who abuses too much the mercy of God will be abandoned by Him”





9. With regard to the body of the discourse, and, in the first place, the proof, it ought to be a
perfect syllogism, but without appearing to be so. The major proposition should be proved
before we pass to the minor; and the minor before we pass to the conclusion. This, however,
is to be understood when the major or minor proposition requires proof: otherwise, when
they express truths already known and certain, it is sufficient to amplify, without proving
them.


10. As far as regards the order of the proofs, generally speaking, the authority of the
Scriptures and of the Holy Fathers should be first adduced; then the arguments from reason;
and afterwards the illustrations and examples. The texts of Scripture should be cited in an
impressive and emphatic manner. It is better than to dwell on the exposition of one or two
texts of Scripture than to cite many at once, without considering well their import. The
citations from the Fathers should be few and brief, and containing some sentiment that is
strong and animated, and not trivial. After the citations, the arguments from reason should
be adduced; concerning which, some assert that the weaker reasons should be adduced in the
first place, and then the stronger; but I am disposed to adopt the opinion of others, who think
it better that the strong arguments should be advanced; and that the weaker ones should
occupy the middle place; because, were a weak argument adduced in the commencement, it
might make a bad impression on the minds of the auditors. After the arguments from reason
come the examples and illustrations. I have said that this arrangement should be observed
ordinarily; but, occasionally, it will be of use to give some one of the aforementioned proofs
precedence of the others: this must be left to the discretion of the preacher.


11. Care should be taken that the transition from one point to the other be made naturally
without passing from one thing to another that has no relation to it. The most ordinary and
easiest modes are these: ” Let us proceed to the other point, etc.; or “Thus, after having seen,"
etc. And passing from one argument to another, you may say: “Besides, we should consider,"
etc., taking care, as far as it is possible, that the last part of the preceding argument has some
connection with the following point or argument.


12. We have spoken of proofs. As far as regards the amplification of proofs, one is verbal,
which consists in words; another is real, which may consist either in climax; for example: "It
is a virtue to suffer tribulations with patience a greater virtue to desire them; it is a greater
still to take delight in them;" or it may be borrowed from the circumstances of the subject, or
from comparison with another subject of equal or lesser consideration. The morals have their
proper place, as we shall remark in the peroration. It is, however, occasionally allowed, after
a satisfactory proof has been adduced, to address a short exhortation; and this is particularly
the case in the sermons of the Mission, in which the audience is generally composed of rude,
uneducated persons, on whom moral exhortation makes more impression; but these moral
exhortations that are incidentally introduced should not be too long or too frequent, so as to
render the discourse tedious or languid.


13. The peroration contains three parts the epilogue, the moral exhortation, and the appeal to
the passions. The epilogue is a recapitulation of the discourse, in which the most convincing
arguments that have been already advanced are repeated, but which must be handled with a
view to the movement of the passions which is to follow; whence the preacher, in his
recapitulation, should commence to move the passions.



### 


14. As to the moral exhortation, it may be observed, that oftentimes the principal fruit of the
sermon consists, especially in discourses addressed to the people, in explaining the moral
truths suitable to the subject of the discourse, with propriety and earnestness. The preacher,
therefore, should take care to speak against the most prevalent vices, viz.: hatred, impurity,
blasphemy; against evil occasions, wicked companions; against parents who allow their
children to hold intercourse with persons of different sex; and especially against mothers
who invite young men into their houses to converse with their daughters. Let him also exhort
the heads of families to remove from their houses bad books, and particularly novels, which
insinuate a secret poison that corrupts youth. Let him speak against games of hazard, which
are the ruin of families and of souls.


15. In a word, let the preacher endeavour, in his sermons, always to insinuate whatever he
can that is practical that is, the remedies of the different vices; the means of persevering in a
virtuous life; such as, to fly dangerous occasions and bad company; to offer violence to one’s
self in motions of anger, so as not to break out into injurious actions or words; by suggesting
to the hearers some form of expression, to avoid blasphemies or imprecations; for example,
”Lord, give me patience!”“Virgin Mary, assist me!" and the like. Let him recommend the
people to hear Mass every morning: to read every day some spiritual book; every morning to
renew the resolutions of not offending God, and to ask the Divine assistance in order to
persevere; to make each day a visit to the most holy sacrament and the Blessed Virgin, in
some representation of her; each evening to make the examination of conscience, with an act
of sorrow; after having committed a sin, immediately to make an act of contrition, and to
confess it as soon as possible: above all, let him recommend his hearers to have recourse to
God and to the Blessed Virgin in the time of temptation, by repeating oftentimes the name of
Jesus and Mary, and continuing to invoke their aid until the temptation ceases. Those means
and remedies should be often repeated by the preacher, and recommended frequently in the
course of his sermons; and he must not be deterred by the apprehension of being criticised by
some learned person, who may remark that the preacher repeated the same things. In
preaching we must not seek the applause of the learned, but the divine approbation and the
advantages of souls, and particularly of poor ignorant persons, who do not profit so much by
thoughts and arguments, as by those easy practices which are suggested and repeated to
them. I say repeated, since those rude and unlettered persons will easily forget what they
hear, unless it is oftentimes repeated to them.


16. Let young preachers also take care to develop, and to commit to memory, their sermons,
before they deliver them from the pulpit. To preach extempore is useful, inasmuch as the
discourse becomes thus more natural and familiar; this, however, is not the case with young
men, but only with those who have been in the habit of preaching for many years; otherwise,
young men would contract a habit of speaking without preparation, and of preaching at
random, saying whatever occurred to them, without any order or arrangement. However,
young preachers should take care to develop their sermons, not in the florid style of elaborate
expression, lofty thoughts, and sounding periods. Read the golden treatise on popular
eloquence by the celebrated scholar, Louis Muratori; in which he proves that all sermons
addressed to an audience composed of learned and unlearned, ought to be not only familiar,
but also popular; composed in an easy and simple style, such as the people are in the habit of
using; avoiding, however, all low and vulgar expressions, which are not suited to the dignity



of the pulpit "The people," says Muratori, "are composed for the most part of the ignorant; if
you address to them abstruse doctrines and reflections, and use words and phrases that are
not adapted to ordinary comprehensions, what fruit do you hope for from persons who do
not understand you? Wherefore, the practice of those preachers will never be conformable to
the rules of the art, or the principles of genuine eloquence, who, instead of accommodating
themselves to the limited capacity of so many of their hearers, appear to study to make
themselves intelligible to the learned only; as if they were ashamed to make themselves
understood by the poor, who have as good a right to the word of God as the learned. Nay
more, a Christian preacher is bound to each one of his auditory in particular, as if there were
no other who heard him. He who employs lofty reasoning, and is not careful to make himself
understood by all, betrays the cause of God and his own duty, and disregards the spiritual
necessities of a great portion of his audience." Hence the Council of Trent prescribes to all
parish priests, to compose their discourses in a manner adapted to the capacity of their
audience: ”Archipresbyteri et parochi per se vel alios idoneos, plebes sibi commissas pro
earum capacitate pascant salutaribus verbis." (Sess. v. cap. i. de Reform.)



17. St. Francis de Sales said, that select language and sounding periods are the bane of sacred
eloquence; and the principal reason of this is, that sermons composed in this style have not
the divine sanction and concurrence. They may be of use to the learned, but not to the
illiterate, who generally constitute the principal part of every audience. On the other hand,
sermons composed in a familiar style are useful to the illiterate as well as to the learned.
Muratori adds, that when the preacher addresses the humbler classes alone, or country
people, he ought to make use of the most popular and familiar style possible, in order to
accommodate himself to the gross understanding of such ignorant persons. He says, that the
preacher, when speaking to those rude people, should imagine himself to be one of them,
who was desirous to persuade a companion of something; that, on this account also, the
periods of sermons addressed to the common people should be concise and broken, so that
whoever has not caught the meaning of the first sentence, may be able to comprehend the
second; which cannot be done when the sentences are long and connected; for then, whoever
does not understand the first period will not understand the second nor the third.


18. Muratori also observes, that, in preaching to the people, it is very useful to make frequent
use of the figure called antiphora; by which a question is asked, and replied to by the
speaker. For example: “Tell me why so many sinners relapse, after confession, into the same
sins ?” I will tell you: because they do not remove the dangerous occasions of sin. It is also
useful oftentimes to call on the auditory to attend to what is said, and especially to certain
things that are more important. For example: ”O good God! you come to us in order to save
us, and we fly from you to destroy ourselves." It is useful likewise to repeat with emphasis
some striking maxim of religion; as, for example: ”There is no alternative: sooner or later we
must die sooner or later we must die ;" or, ”My brethren, it is certain that, after this life, we
must be eternally happy, or eternally miserable. ”


19. I do not enlarge more on this subject, which I deem most important, as I have found it
necessary to write more at length on it in a letter of apology which I published in reply to a
religious who censured me for approving of sermons composed in a simple and popular
style. I there premised in a sufficient manner whatever Muratori has observed on this subject,
and subjoined what the Holy Fathers have written on it, as far as I was able to discover. I



pray the reader not to omit to read this letter: it is an uncommon little treatise, which contains
matter not treated by any preceding writer.



20. I do not, however, deem it right to omit to say something on the modulation of the voice,
and on the gesture which should be used in preaching. As far as regards the voice, the
preacher should avoid speaking in an inflated tone, or in a monotonous and invariably loud
tone of voice. What moves and engages the attention of the hearers is, to speak at one time in
a strong, at another time in a middle voice, and at another in a low voice, according as it suits
the sentiment that is expressed, but without any sudden or violent fall or elevation; now to
exclaim; now to pause; and now to resume with a sigh. This variety of tone and manner
keeps the audience always attentive.


21. The preacher should avoid gesture that is affected, or oftentimes repeated in the same
form, or too vehement, with much agitation of the body. The arms should be moved with
moderation: ordinarily the right hand should be used; the left but seldom. The hands should
not be raised above the head, nor too much extended sideways, nor held too confined. In
delivering the exordium the preacher should remain stationery, and should not move from a
middle position in the pulpit: in delivering the first sentence he should not use gesture; in the
second, he should only commence to move the right hand, keeping the left resting on the
pulpit or the breast. Let him take care not to keep the arms attached close to the sides, or to
raise them both at the same time in form of a cross, or throw them behind the shoulders. He
must rarely strike them against each other or against the pulpit: to stamp the feet is very
unbecoming. The motion of the head should correspond with that of the hand,
accompanying it in the direction in which, it moves. It is a fault to twist the head, or move it
too often or too violently, or to hold it always raised, or always inclined upon the breast. The
eyes ought to accompany the motion of the head; whence it is a fault to keep them always
closed or cast downwards, or fixed immoveably in one direction. It may be permitted
sometimes to sit down, but it should be seldom. The same may be said of moving back and
forward: but the preacher should never run from one side of the pulpit to the other. He
should, for the most part, speak from a middle position, so as to be seen equally from either
side; but it is useful to incline occasionally to the right or left, without, however, turning the
back to the opposite direction. Finally, as far as regards the length of the sermon. The Lent
sermons should not exceed an hour; and the Sunday discourses should not occupy more than
three quarters of an hour; but the parochial instructions should not be longer than a half-
hour, including the act of contrition, to which, ordinarily, it is advisable to accustom the
common people; making them, at the close of the sermon, have recourse to the mother of
God, to ask of her some particular grace as, holy perseverance, a happy death, the love of
Jesus Christ, and the like. Nor does it signify, that in order to make room for the act of
contrition, the time of the sermon must be shortened; for these acts are the most precious fruit
to be derived from it. It were well that the preacher should sometimes exhort the audience to
relate to others what they have heard in the sermon; as by this means it may be made useful
even to those who have not heard it.
    
**SERMON I. FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT. - ON THE GENERAL JUDGMENT.**
**_"And they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven with much power and
majesty." Matt. xxiv. 30._**





AT present God is not known, and, therefore, he is as much despised by sinners, as if he
could not avenge, whenever he pleases, the injuries offered to him. The wicked” **_looketh upon
the Almighty as if he could do nothing”_** (Job xxii. 17,) But the Lord has fixed a day, called in
the Scriptures "the day of the Lord," on which the Eternal Judge will make known his power
and majesty. ” **_The Lord,"_** says the Psalmist, **_"shall be known when he executeth judgment."_**
(Ps. ix. 17.) On this text St. Bernard writes: ” **_The Lord, who is now unknown while he seeks
mercy, shall be known when he executes justice."_** (Lib. de xii. Rad.) The prophet Sophonias
calls the day of the Lord” **_a day of wrath a day of tribulation and distress a day of calamity
and misery."_** (i. 15.)


Let us now consider, in the first point, the different appearance of the just and the unjust; in
the second, the scrutiny of consciences; and in the third, the sentence pronounced on the elect
and on the reprobate.
**_First Point On the different appearance of the just and of sinners in the valley of Josaphat._**



1. This day shall commence with fire from Heaven, which will burn the earth, all men then
living, and all things upon the earth. ” **_And the earth and the works which are in it shall be
burnt up."_** (2 Pet. iii. 10.) All shall become one heap of ashes.


2 After the death of all men, **_“the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again."_** (1 Cor.
xv. 52.) St Jerome used to say: **_“As often as I consider the day of judgment, I tremble. Whether
I eat or drink, or whatever else I do, that terrible trumpet appears to sound in my ears, arise
ye dead, and come to judgment"_** (in Matt, c. v.); and St. Augustine declared, that nothing
banished from him earthly thoughts so effectually as the fear of judgment.


3 At the sound of that trumpet the souls of the blessed shall descend from Heaven to be
united to the bodies with which they served God on Earth; and the unhappy souls of the
damned shall come up from Hell to take possession again of those bodies with which they
have offended God. Oh! how different the appearance of the former, compared with that of
the latter! The damned shall appear deformed and black, like so many firebrands of Hell; but
the just shall shine as the sun (Matt xiii 43) Oh! how great shall then be the happiness of those
who have fortified their bodies by works of penance! We may estimate their felicity from the
words addressed by St. Peter of Alcantara, after death, to St. Teresa: **_“O happy penance!
which merited for me such glory”_**


4. After the resurrection, they shall be summoned by the angels to appear in the valley of
Josaphat. **_“Nations, nations, in the valley for destruction for the day of the Lord is near‟‟_**
(Joel iii 14)” Then the angels shall come and separate the reprobate from the elect, placing the
latter on the right, and the former on the left. **_”The angels shall go out, and shall separate the
wicked from the Just. ”_** (Matt. xiii 49). Oh! How great will then be the confusion which the
unhappy damned shall suffer!. **_“What think you, ”_** says the author of the Imperfect Work,
**_“must be the confusion of the impious, when, being separated from the just, they shall be
abandoned”_** (Hom liv.). **_“This punishment alone”_** says St. Chrysostom, **_“would be sufficient to
constitute a hell for the wicked”. ”Et si nihil ulterius paterentur, ista sola verecundia
sufficerit eis ad pœnam," (in Matt, c. xxiv.) The brother shall he separated from the brother,
the husband from his wife, the son from the father, etc._**





5. But, behold! the heavens are opened the angels come to assist at the general judgment,
carrying, as St. Thomas says, the sign of the cross and of the other instruments of the passion
of the Redeemer. ” **_Veniente Domino ad judicium signum crucis, et alia passionis indicia
demonstrabunt." (Opusc. ii. 244.)_** The same may be inferred from the twenty-fourth chapter
of St. Matthew: ” **_And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in Heaven; and then shall
all the tribes of the earth mourn." (xxiv. 30.)_** Sinners shall weep at the sign of the cross; for, as
St. Chrysostom says, the nails will complain of them the wounds and the cross of Jesus Christ
will speak against them. ” **_Clavi de te conquerentur, cicatrices contra et loquentur, crux
Christi contra te perorabit." (Hom, xx., in Matt.)_**


6. Most holy Mary, the queen of saints and angels, shall come to assist at the last judgment;
and lastly, the Eternal Judge shall appear in the clouds, full of splendour and majesty. “And
they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of Heaven with much power and
majesty." (Matt. xxiv. 30.) Oh! how great shall be the agony of the reprobate at the sight of the
Judge! **_"At their presence”_** says the Prophet Joel, **_"the people shall be in grievous pains."_** (Joel
ii. 6.) According to St. Jerome, the presence of Jesus Christ will give the reprobate more pain
than Hell itself. **_“It would,"_** he says, ” **_be easier for the damned to bear the torments of Hell
than the presence of the Lord."_** Hence, on that day, the wicked shall, according to St. John,
call on the mountains to fall on them and to hide them from the sight of the judge. **_"And they
shall say to the mountains and the rocks: Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that
sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb."_** (Apoc. vi. 16.)


**_Second Point. The scrutiny of conscience._**



7. **_"The judgment sat, and the books were opened. ”_** (Dan. vii. 10.) The books of conscience are
opened, and the judgment commences. The Apostle says, that the Lord” **_will bring to light
the hidden things of darkness."_** (1 Cor. iv. 5.) And, by the mouth of his prophet, Jesus Christ
has said: ” **_I will search Jerusalem with lamps."_** (Soph. i. 12.) The light of the lamp reveals all
that is hidden.


8. ” **_A judgment,"_** says St. Chrysostom, ” **_terrible to sinners, but desirable and sweet to the
just."_** (Hom. iii. de Dav.) The last judgment shall fill sinners with terror, but will be a source
of joy and sweetness to the elect; for God will then give praise to each one according to his
works. (1 Cor. iv. 5.) The Apostle tells us that on that day the just will be raised above the
clouds to be united to the angels, and to increase the number of those who pay homage to the
Lord. ” **_We shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air."_** (I
Thess. iv. 16.)


9. Worldlings now regard as fools the saints who led mortified and humble lives; but then
they shall confess their own folly, and say: **_"We fools esteemed their life madness, and their
end without honour. Behold how they are numbered among the children of God, and their lot
is among the saints."_** (Wis. v. 4, 5.) In this world, the rich and the noble are called happy; but
true happiness consists in a life of sanctity. Rejoice, ye souls who live in tribulation;” **_our
sorrow shall be turned into joy."_** (John xvi. 20.) In the valley of Josaphat you shall be seated
on thrones of glory.





10. But the reprobate, like goats destined for the slaughter, shall be placed on the left, to await
their last condemnation. ” **_Judicii tempus," says St. Chrysostom, ”misericordiam non recipit."
On the day of judgment there is no hope of mercy for poor sinners._** “ **_Magna," says St.
Augustine, "jam est pœna peccati, metum et memoriam divini perdidisse judicii."_** (Serm. xx.
de Temp.) **_The greatest punishment of sin in those who live in enmity with God, is to lose the
fear and remembrance of the divine judgment._** Continue, continue, says the Apostle, to live
obstinately in sin; but in proportion to your obstinacy, you shall have accumulated for the
day of judgment a treasure of the wrath of God **_“But according to thy hardness and
impenitent heart , thou treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath”_** (Rom ii. 5)


11. Then sinners will not be able to hide themselves but, with insufferable pain, they shall be
compelled to appear in judgment. **_"To lie hid”_** says St. Anselm, **_“will be impossible to appear
will be intolerable."_** The devils will perform their office of accusers, and as St. Augustine
says, will say to the Judge: **_“Most just God, declare him to be mine, who was unwilling to be
yours. ”_** The witnesses against the wicked shall be first, their own conscience**_. "Their
conscience bearing witness to them, ”_** (Rom. ii. 15); secondly, the very walls of the house in
which they sinned shall cry out against them” **_The stone shall cry out of the wall,"_** (Hab. ii
11); thirdly, the Judge himself will say **_"I am the judge and the witness, saith the Lord."_** (Jer.
xxix 23 ) Hence, according to St. Augustine, **_"He who is now the witness of .your life, shall be
the judge of your cause. ”_** (Lib. x. de Chord., c. ii.) To Christians particularly he will say: **_"Woe
to thee, Corozain, woe to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the
miracles that have been wrought in you, they had long ago done penance in sackcloth and
ashes”_** (Matt. xi. 21.) Christians, he will say, if the graces which I have bestowed on you had
been given to the Turks or to the Pagans, they would have done penance for their sins; but
you have ceased to sin only with your death. He shall then manifest to all men their most
hidden crimes. **_"I will discover thy shame to thy face. ”_** (Nahum iii. 5.) He will expose to
view all their secret impurities, injustices, and cruelties. ” **_I will set all thy abominations
against thee”_** (Ezech. vii. 3.) Each of the damned shall carry his sins written on his forehead.


12. What excuses can save the wicked on that day? Ah! they can offer no excuses. ” **_All
iniquity shall stop her mouth."_** (Ps. cvi. 42.) Their very sins shall close the mouth of the
reprobate, so that they will not have courage to excuse themselves. They shall pronounce
their own condemnation.


**_Third Point. Sentence of the elect, and of the reprobate._**


13. St. Bernard says, that **_the sentence of the elect, and their destiny to eternal glory, shall be
first declared, that the pains of the reprobate may be increased by the sight of what they lost. ”Prius pronunciabitur sententia electis ut acrius (reprobi) doleant videntes quid amiserunt."_**
(Ser. viii., in Ps. xc.) Jesus Christ, then, shall first turn to the elect, and with a serene
countenance shall say: " **_Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world. ”_** (Matt. xxv. 34.) He will then bless all the tears shed
through sorrow for their sins, and all their good works, their prayers, mortifications, and
communions; above all, he will bless for them the pains of his passion and the blood shed for
their salvation. And, after these benedictions, the elect, singing alleluias, shall enter Paradise
to praise and love God eternity.





14. The Judge shall then turn to the reprobate, and shall pronounce the sentence of their
condemnation in these words. ” **_Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire."_** (Matt.
xxv. 41 ) They shall then be forever accursed, separated from God, and sent to burn for ever
in the fire of hell. “ **_And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just into life
everlasting. ”_** (Matt. xxv. 46.)


15. After this sentence, the wicked shall, according to St. Ephrem, be compelled to take leave
for ever of their relatives, of Paradise, of the saints, and of Mary the divine Mother.
**_"Farewell, ye just! Farewell, O cross I Farewell, Paradise! Farewell, fathers and brothers: we
shall never see you again! Farewell, O Mary, mother of God!”_** (St. Eph. de variis serm. inf.)
Then a great pit shall open in the middle of the valley: the unhappy damned shall be cast into
it, and shall see those doors shut which shall never again be opened. O accursed sin! to what a miserable end will you one day conduct so many souls redeemed by the blood of Jesus
Christ. O unhappy souls! for whom is prepared such a melancholy end. But, brethren, have confidence. Jesus Christ is now a Father, and not judge. He is ready to pardon all who repent.
Let us then instantly ask pardon from him. **[Let the preacher here propose for the people an act of sorrow, a purpose of amendment, and a prayer to Jesus and to Mary for the gift
of holy perseverance. Let him repeat the same at the end of every sermon.]** 

**SERMON II. SECOND SUNDAY OF ADVENT. - ON THE ADVANTAGES OF
TRIBULATIONS.** 

**_" Now when John had heard of the wonderful works of Christ," etc. MATT. ix. 2._**


IN tribulations God enriches his beloved souls with the greatest graces. Behold, St. John in his chains comes to the knowledge of the works of Jesus Christ: ” When John had heard in prison
the works of Christ." Great indeed are the advantages of tribulations. The Lord sends them to us, not because he wishes our misfortune, but because he desires our welfare. Hence, when
they come upon us we must embrace them with thanksgiving, and must not only resign ourselves to the divine will, but must also rejoice that God treats us as he treated his Son
Jesus Christ, whose life, upon this earth was always full of tribulation. I shall now show, in the first point, the advantages we derive from tribulations; and in the second, I shall point out
the manner in which we ought to bear them. 

**_First Point. On the great advantages we derive from tribulations._**



1. **_"What doth he know that had not been tried? A man that hath much experience shall think
of many things, and he that hath learned many things shall show forth understanding."_** (Eccl. xxxiv. 9.) They who live in prosperity, and have no experience of adversity, know
nothing of the state of their souls. In the first place, tribulation opens the eyes which
prosperity had kept shut. St. Paul remained blind after Jesus Christ appeared to him, and,
during his blindness, he perceived the errors in which he lived. During his imprisonment in
Babylon, King Manasses had recourse to God, was convinced of the malice of his sins, and id
penance for them. "And after that he was in distress he prayed to the Lord his God, and did
penance exceedingly before the God of his fathers." (2 Paral. xxxiii. 12.) The prodigal, when
he found himself under the necessity of feeding swine, and afflicted with hunger, exclaimed:
”I will arise and go to my father." (Luke xv. 18.)





Secondly, tribulation takes from our hearts all affections to earthly things. When a mother
wishes to wean her infant she puts gall on the paps, to excite his disgust, and induce him to
take better food. God treats us in a similar manner: to detach us from temporal goods, he
mingles them with gall, that by tasting its bitterness, we may conceive a dislike for them, and
place our affections on the things of Heaven. ” **_God,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_mingles bitterness
with earthly pleasures, that we may seek another felicity, whose sweetness does not
deceive."_** (Ser. xxix., de Verb. Dom.)


Thirdly, they who live in prosperity are molested by many temptations of pride , of vain-
glory; of desires of acquiring greater wealth, great honours, and greater pleasures.
Tribulations free us from these temptations, and make us humble and content in the state in
which the Lord has placed us. Hence the Apostle says: ” **_We are chastised by the Lord that we
may not be condemned with this world."_** (1 Cor. xi. 32.)



2. Fourthly, by tribulation we atone for the sins we have committed much better than by
voluntary works of penance. **_"Be assured,"_** says St. Augustine, **_"that God is a physician, and
that tribulation is a salutary medicine."_** Oh! how great is the efficacy of tribulation in
healing the wounds caused by our sins! Hence, the same saint rebukes the sinner who
complains of God for sending him tribulations. ” **_Why,"_** he says, ” **_do you complain? What
you suffer is a remedy, not a punishment."_** (In Ps. lv.) Job called those happy men whom God
corrects by tribulation; because he heals them with the very hands with which he strikes and
wounds them. **_"Blessed is the man whom God correcteth.... For he woundeth and cureth. He
striketh, and his hand shall heal."_** (Job v. 17, 18.) Hence, St. Paul gloried in his tribulations:
” **_Gloriamur in tribulationibus."_** (Rom. v. 3.)


3. Fifthly, by convincing us that God alone is able and willing to relieve us in our miseries,
tribulations remind us of him, and compel us to have recourse to his mercy. ” **_In their
affliction they will rise early to me."_** (Osee vi. 1.) Hence, addressing the afflicted, the Lord
said: ” **_Come to me, all you that labour and are burdened, and I will refresh you."_** (Matt. xi.
28.) Hence he is called” **_a helper in troubles."_** (Ps. xlv. 1 .) **_“When,"_** says David, **_" he slew them,
then they sought him, and they returned."_** (Ps. lxxvii. 34.) When the Jews were afflicted, and
were slain by their enemies, they remembered the Lord, and returned to him.


4. Sixthly, tribulations enable us to acquire great merits before God, by giving us
opportunities of exercising the virtues of humility, of patience, and of resignation to the
divine will. The venerable John d’Avila used to say, that a single blessed be God: in
adversity, is worth more than a thousand acts in prosperity. ” **_Take away,"_** says St. Ambrose,
” **_the contests of the martyrs, and you have taken away their crowns."_** (In Luc., c. iv.) Oh!
what a treasure of merit is acquired by patiently bearing insults, poverty, and sickness!
Insults from men were the great objects of the desires of the saints, who sought to be
despised for the love of Jesus Christ, and thus to be made like unto him.


5. How great is the merit gained by bearing with the inconvenience of poverty. ” **_My God and
my all,"_** says St. Francis of Assisium: in expressing this sentiment, he enjoyed more of true
riches than all the princes of the Earth. How truly has St. Teresa said, that” **_the less we have
here, the more we shall enjoy hereafter."_** Oh! how happy is the man who can say from his
heart: My Jesus, thou alone art sufficient for me! If, says St. Chrysostom, **_you esteem yourself_**



**_unhappy because you are poor, you are indeed miserable and deserving of tears; not because
you are poor, but because, being poor, you do not embrace your poverty, and esteem yourself
happy."_** “ **_Sane dignus es lachrymis ob hoc, quod miserum te extimas, non ideo quod pauper
es."_** (Serm, ii., Epis. ad Phil.)


```


```
6. By bearing patiently with the pains of sickness, a great, and perhaps the greater, part of the
crown which is prepared for us in Heaven is completed. The sick sometimes complain that in
sickness they can do nothing; but they err; for, in their infirmities they can do all things, by
accepting their sufferings with peace and resignation. ” **_The Cross of Christ,"_** says St.
Chrysostom, ” **_is the key of Paradise."_** (Com. in Luc. de vir.)


7. St. Francis de Sales used to say. ” **_To suffer constantly for Jesus is the science of the saints;
we shall thus soon become saints."_** It is by sufferings that God proves his servants, and finds
them worthy of himself. ” **_Deus tentavit es, et invenit eos dignos se."_** (Wis. iii. 5) **_"Whom,"_**
says St. Paul, **_"the Lord loveth, he chastiseth; and he scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."_**
(Heb. xii. 6.) Hence, Jesus Christ once said to St. Teresa: ” **_Be assured that the souls dearest to
my Father are those who suffer the greatest afflictions."_** Hence Job said: ” **_If we have received
good things at the hand of God, why should we not receive evil ?"_** (Job. ii. 10.) If we have
gladly received from God the goods of this Earth, why should we not receive more cheerfully
tribulations, which are far more useful to us than worldly prosperity? St. Gregory informs us
that, as flame fanned by the wind increases, so the soul is made perfect when she is
oppressed by tribulations. ” **_Ignis flatu premitur, ut crescat."_** (Ep. xxv.)


8. To holy souls the most severe afflictions are the temptations by which the Devil impels
them to offend God: but they who bear these temptations with patience, and banish them by
turning to God for help, shall acquire great merit. ” **_And,"_** says St. Paul, ” **_God is faithful, who
will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able, but will also make issue
with the temptation that you may be able to bear it."_** (1 Cor. x. 13.) God permits us to be
molested by temptations, that, by banishing them, we may gain greater merit. ” **_Blessed,"_** says
the Lord, ” **_are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. ”_** (Matt. v. 5.) They are blessed,
because, according to the Apostle, our tribulations are momentary and very light, compared
with the greatness of the glory which they shall obtain for us for eternity in Heaven. ” **_For
that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, worketh for us above
measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory”_** (1 Cor. iv. 17.)


9. It is necessary, then, says St. Chrysostom, to bear tribulations in peace; **_for, if you accept
them with resignation, you shall gain great merit; but if you submit to them with reluctance,
you shall increase, instead of diminishing, your misery”Si vero ægre feras, neque
calamitatum minorem facies, et majorem reddes procellam”_** (Hom. Ixiv., ad Pop.) If we wish
to be saved, we must submit to trials. ” **_Through many tribulations we must enter into the
kingdom of God."_** (Acts xiv. 21.) A great servant of God used to say, that Paradise is the place
of the poor, of the persecuted, of the humble and afflicted. Hence St. Paul says: **_"Patience is
necessary for you, that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise."_** (Heb. x. 36.)
Speaking of the tribulations of the saints, St. Cyprian asks” **_What are they to the servants of
God, whom Paradise invites ?"_** (Ep, ad Demetr.) Is it much for those to whom the eternal
goods of Heaven are promised, to embrace the short afflictions of this life?



### 


10. In fine, the scourges of Heaven are sent not for our injury, but for our good. ”Let us
believe that these scourges of the Lord, with which, like servants, we are chastised, have
happened for our amendment, and not for our destruction." (Judith viii. 27.)”God," says St.
Augustine, ”is angry when he does not scourge the sinner." (In Ps. Ixxxix.) When we see a
sinner in tribulation in this life, we may infer that God wishes to have mercy on him in the
next, and that he exchanges eternal for temporal chastisement. But miserable the sinner
whom the Lord does not punish in this life! For those whom he does not chastise here, he
treasures up his wrath, and for them he reserves eternal chastisement.


11. ” **_Why,"_** asks the Prophet Jeremiah, ” **_doth the way of the wicked prosper?”_** (xii. 1.) Why,
Lord, do sinners prosper? To this the same prophet answers: ” **_Gather them together as sheep
for a sacrifice, and prepare them for the day of slaughter."_** (Tb. v. 3.) As on the day of
sacrifice the sheep intended for slaughter are gathered together, so the impious, as victims of
divine wrath, are destined to eternal death. **_"Destine them,"_** says Du Hamel, in his
commentary on this passage, **_"as victims of thy anger on the day of sacrifice."_**


12. When, then, God sends us tribulations, let us say with Job: **_"I have sinned, and indeed I
have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved."_** (Job xxxiii. 27.) O Lord, my
sins merit far greater chastisement than that which thou hast inflicted on me. We should even
pray with St. Augustine, ” **_Burn cut spare not in this life, that thou mayest spare for
eternity."_** How frightful is the chastisement of the sinner of whom the Lord says: “ **_Let us
have pity on the wicked, but he will not learn justice."_** (Is. xxvi. 10.) Let us abstain from
chastising the impious: as long as they remain in this life they will continue to live in sin, and
shall thus be punished with eternal torments. On this passage St. Bernard says:
**_"Misericordiam hanc nolo, super omnem iram miseratio ista." (Serin, xlii., in Cant.) Lord, I
do not wish for such mercy, which is a chastisement that surpasses all chastisements._**


13. The man whom the Lord afflicts in this life has a certain proof that he is dear to God.
” **_And,"_** said the angel to Tobias, ” **_because thou wast acceptable to God, it was necessary that
temptations should prove thee."_** (Tob. xii. 13.) Hence, St. James pronounces blessed the man
who is afflicted: **_because after he shall have been proved by tribulation, he will receive the
crown of life."_** (Jam. i. 12.)


14. He who wishes to share in the glory of the saints, must suffer in this life as the saints have
suffered. None of the saints has been esteemed or treated well by the world all of them have
been despised and persecuted. In them have been verified the words of the Apostle: **_"All that
will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution."_** (2 Tim. iii. 12.) Hence St. Augustine
said, **_that they who are unwilling to suffer persecutions, have not as yet begun to be
Christians. “Si putas non habere persecutiones, nondum cæpisti esse Christianus."_** (In Ps. Iv.)
"When we are in tribulation, let us be satisfied with the consolation of knowing that the Lord
is then near us and in our company. ” **_The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite
heart."_** (Ps. xxxiii. 19.)” **_I am with him in tribulation."_** (Ps. xc. 15.)


**_Second Point. On the manner in which we should bear tribulations._**


15. He who suffers tribulations in this world should, in the first place, abandon sin, and
endeavour to recover the grace of God; for as long as he remains in sin, the merit of all his



sufferings is lost. ” **_If,"_** says St. Paul, ” **_I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not
charity, it profiteth me nothing."_** (1 Cor. xiii. 3.) If you suffered all the torments of the
martyrs; or bore to be burned alive, and were not in the state of grace, it would profit you
nothing.



16. But, to those who can suffer with God, and with resignation for God’s sake, all the
tribulations shall be a source of comfort and gladness. ” **_Your sorrow shall be turned into
joy."_** (John xvi. 20.) Hence, after having been insulted and beaten by the Jews, the apostles
departed from the council full of joy, because they had been maltreated for the love of Jesus
Christ. ” **_And they indeed went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were
accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus."_** (Acts v. 41.) Hence, when God
visits us with any tribulations, we must say with Jesus Christ: ” **_The chalice which my Father
hath given me, shall I not drink it_** ?" (John xviii. 11.) It is necessary to know that every
tribulation, though it may come from men, is sent to us by God.


17. When we are surrounded on all sides with tribulations, and know not what to do, we
must turn to God, who alone can console us. Thus King Josaphat, in his distress, said to the
Lord: **_"As we know not what to do, we can only turn our eyes to thee."_** (2 Par. xx. 12.) Thus
David also in his tribulation had recourse to God, and God consoled him: **_"In my trouble I
cried to the Lord, and he heard me."_** (Ps. cxix. 1.) We should turn to God, and pray to him,
and never cease to pray till he hears us. ” **_As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her
mistress, so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us."_** (Ps. cxxii. 2.) We
must keep our eyes continually raised to God, and must continue to implore his aid, until he
is moved to compassion for our miseries. We must have great confidence in the heart of Jesus
Christ, and ought not to imitate certain persons, who instantly lose courage because they do
not feel that they are heard as soon as they begin to pray. To them may be applied the words
of the Saviour to St. Peter: **_"0 thou of little faith! why didst thou doubt?"_** (Matt. xiv. 31.)
When the favours which we ask are spiritual, or can be profitable to our souls, we should be
certain of being heard, provided we persevere in prayer, and do not lose confidence. ” **_All
things whatsoever you ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come
unto you."_** (Mark xi. 24.) In tribulations, then, we should never cease to hope with confidence
that the divine mercy will console us; and if our afflictions continue, we must say with Job:
” **_Although he should kill me, I will trust in him."_** (xiii. 15.)


18. Souls of little faith, instead of turning to God in their tribulations, have recourse to human
means, and thus provoke God’s anger, and remain in their miseries. **_“Unless the Lord build
the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in
vain that keepeth it."_** (Ps. cxxvi. 1.) On this passage St. Augustine writes: **_"Ipse ædificat, ipse
intellectum aperit, ipse ad finem applicat sensum vestrum: et tamen laboramus et nos
tanquam operarii, sed nisi Dominus custodierit civitatem," etc. All good all help must come
from the Lord. Without him creatures can give us no assistance._**


19. Of this the Lord complains by the mouth of his prophet: ”Is not," he says, ”the Lord in
Sion?.. .Why then have they provoked me to wrath with their idols... Is there no balm in
Galaad? or is there no physician there? Why then is not the wound of the daughter of my
people closed?" (Jer. viii. 19, 22.) Am I not in Sion? Why then do men provoke me to anger by
recurring to creatures, which they convert into idols by placing in them all their hopes? Do



they seek a remedy for their miseries? Why do they not seek it in Galaad, a mountain full of
balsamic ointments, which signify the divine mercy? There they can find the physician and
the remedy of all their evils. Why then, says the Lord, do your wounds remain open? Why
are they not healed? It is because you have recourse not to me, but to creatures, and because
you confide in them, and not in me.



20. In another place the Lord says: **_"Am I become a wilderness to Israel, or a late ward
springing land? Why then have my people said: We are revolted; we will come to thee no
more ?. .But my people have forgotten me days without number."_** (Jer. ii. 31, 32.) God
complains, and says: ”Why, my children, do you say that you will have recourse to me no
more? Am I become to you a barren land, which gives no fruit, or gives it too late? Is it for
this reason that you have so long forgotten me? By these words he manifests to us his desire
that we pray to him, in order that he may be able to give us his graces; and he also gives us to
understand that when we pray to him, he is not slow, but instantly begins to assist us.


21. The Lord, says David, is not asleep when we turn to his goodness, and ask the graces
which are profitable to our souls: he hears us immediately, because he is anxious for our
welfare. **_"Behold, he shall neither slumber nor sleep that keepeth Israel."_** (Ps. cxx. 4.) When
we pray for temporal favours, St. Bernard says that God” **_will give what we ask, or something
more useful."_** He will grant us the grace which we desire, whenever it is profitable to our
souls; or he will give us a more useful grace, such as the grace to resign ourselves to the
divine will, and to suffer with patience our tribulations, which shall merit a great increase of
glory in Heaven.
**_[Act of sorrow and amendment, prayer to Jesus and Mary.]_**


**SERMON III. THIRD SUNDAY OP ADVENT. - ON THE MEANS NECESSARY FOR
SALVATION.** **_“I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord." John i.
23._**


ALL would wish to be saved and to enjoy the glory of Paradise; but to gain Heaven, it is
necessary to walk in the straight road that leads to eternal bliss. This road is the observance
of the divine commands. Hence, in his preaching, the Baptist exclaimed: **_"Make straight the
way of the Lord."_** In order to be able to walk always in the way of the Lord, without turning
to the right or to the left, it is necessary to adopt the proper means. These means are, first,
diffidence in ourselves; secondly, confidence in God; thirdly, resistance to temptations.


**_First Means. Diffidence in ourselves._**
1. ” **_With fear and trembling,"_** says the Apostle, ” **_work out your salvation."_** (Phil. ii. 12.) To
secure eternal life, we must be always penetrated with fear, we must be always afraid of
ourselves (with fear and trembling), and distrust altogether our own strength; for, without
the divine grace we can do nothing. ” **_Without me,"_** says Jesus Christ, ” **_you can do nothing."_**
We can do nothing for the salvation of our own souls. St. Paul tells us, that of ourselves we
are not capable of even a good thought. ” **_Not that we are sufficient to think anything of
ourselves, as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God."_** (2 Cor. iii. 5.) Without the aid of
the Holy Ghost, we cannot even pronounce the name of Jesus so as to deserve a reward. ” **_And
no one can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost”_** (1 Cor. xii. 8.)





2. Miserable the man who trusts to himself in the way of God. St. Peter experienced the sad
effects of self-confidence. Jesus Christ said to him: ” **_In this night, before cock-crow, thou wilt
deny me thrice."_** (Matt. xxvi. 31.) Trusting in his own strength and his goodwill, the Apostle
replied: ” **_Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee."_** (v. 35.) What was the
result? On the night on which Jesus Christ had been taken, Peter was reproached in the court
of Caiphas with being one of the disciples of the Saviour. The reproach filled him with fear:
he thrice denied his Master, and swore that he had never known him. Humility and
diffidence in ourselves are so necessary for us, that God permits us sometimes to fall into sin,
that, by our fall, we may acquire humility arid a knowledge of our own weakness. Through
want of humility David also fell: hence, after his sin, he said: ” **_Before I was humbled, I
offended."_** (Ps. cxviii. 67.)


3. Hence the Holy Ghost pronounces blessed the man who is always in fear: ” **_Blessed is the
man who is always fearful."_** (Prov. xxviii. 14.) He who is afraid of falling distrusts his own
strength, avoids as much as possible all dangerous occasions, and recommends himself often
to God, and thus preserves his soul from sin. But the man who is not fearful, but full of self-
confidence, easily exposes himself to the danger of sin: he seldom recommends himself to
God, and thus he falls. Let us imagine a person suspended over a great precipice by a cord
held by another. Surely he would constantly cry out to the person who supports him: Hold
fast, hold fast; for Gods sake, do not let go. We are all in danger of falling into the abyss of all
crime, if God does not support us. Hence we should constantly beseech him to keep his
hands over us, and to succour us in all dangers.


4. In rising from bed, St. Philip Neri used to say every morning: **_Lord, keep thy hand this day
over Philip; if thou do not, Philip will betray thee._** And one day, as he walked through the
city, reflecting on his own misery, he frequently said, **_I despair, I despair._** A Certain religious
who heard him, believing that the saint was really tempted to despair, corrected him, and
encouraged him to hope in the divine mercy. But the saint replied: **_"I despair of myself, but I
trust in God."_** Hence, during this life, in which we are exposed to so many dangers of losing
God, it is necessary for us to live always in great diffidence of ourselves, and full of
confidence in God.


**_Second Means. Confidence in God._**


5. St. Francis de Sales says, that the mere attention to self- diffidence on account of our own
weakness, would only render us pusillanimous, and expose us to great danger of abandoning
ourselves to a tepid life, or even to despair. The more we distrust our own strength, the more
we should confide in the divine mercy. This is a balance, says the same saint, in which the
more the scale of confidence in God is raised, the more the scale of diffidence in ourselves
descends.


6. Listen to me, O sinners who have had the misfortune of having hitherto offended God, and
of being condemned to hell: if the Devil tells you that but little hope remains of your eternal
salvation, answer him in the words of the Scripture: ” **_No one hath hoped in the Lord, and
hath been confounded. ”_** (Eccl. ii. 11.) No sinner has ever trusted in God, and has been lost.
Make, then, a firm purpose to sin no more; abandon yourselves into the arms of the divine
goodness; and rest



assured that God will have mercy on you, and save you from Hell. ” **_Cast thy care upon the
Lord, and he shall sustain thee."_** (Ps. liv. 23.) The Lord, as we read in Blosius, one day said to
St. Gertrude: ” **_He who confides in me, does me such violence that I cannot but hear all his
petitions”_**


7. ” **_But,"_** says the Prophet Isaias, ” **_they that hope in the Lord shall renew their strength; they
shall take wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint."_**
(xl. 31.) They who place their confidence in God shall renew their strength; they shall lay
aside their own weakness, and shall acquire the strength of God; they shall fly like eagles in
the way of the Lord, without fatigue and without ever failing. David says, that” **_mercy shall
encompass him that hopeth in the Lord."_** (Ps. xxxi. 10.) He that hopes in the Lord shall be
encompassed by his mercy, so that he shall never be abandoned by it.



8. St. Cyprian says, that the divine mercy is an inexhaustible fountain. They who bring
vessels of the greatest .confidence, draw from it the greatest graces Hence the Royal Prophet
has said: **_"Let thy mercy Lord be upon us, as we have hoped in thee."_** (Ps. xxxii. 22.)
Whenever the Devil terrifies us by placing before our eyes the great difficulty of persevering
in the grace of God in spite of all the dangers and sinful occasions of this life, let us, without
answering him, raise our eyes to God, and hope that in his goodness he will certainly send us
help to resist every attack. **_“I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help
shall come to me."_** (Ps. cxx. 1.) And when the enemy represents to us our weakness, let us say
with the Apostle **_"I can do all in him who strengtheneth me. ”_** (Phil. iv. 13 ) Of myself I can
do nothing; but I trust in God, that by his grace I shall be able to do all things.


9. Hence, in the midst of the greatest dangers of perdition to which we are exposed, we
should continually turn to Jesus Christ, and. throwing ourselves into the hands of him who
redeemed us by his death, should say: **_Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast
redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth."_** (Ps. xxx. 6.) This prayer should be said with great
confidence of obtaining eternal life, and to it we should add: **_"In thee, O Lord, I have hoped;
let me not be confounded forever”_** (Ps. xxx. 1.)


**_Third Means. Resistance to temptations._**


10. It is true that when we have recourse to God with confidence in dangerous temptations,
he assists us; but, in certain very urgent occasions, the Lord sometimes wishes that we
cooperate, and do violence to ourselves, to resist temptations. On such occasions, it will not
be enough to have recourse to God once or twice; it will be necessary to multiply prayers,
and frequently to prostrate ourselves and send up our sighs before the image of the Blessed
Virgin and the crucifix, crying out with tears: Mary, my mother, assist me; **_Jesus, my Saviour,
save me, for thy mercy‟s sake do not abandon me, do not permit me to lose thee._**


11. Let us keep in mind the words of the Gospel: “ **_How narrow is the gate and strait is the
way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it."_** (Matt. vii. 14.) The way to Heaven is
strait and narrow: they who wish to arrive at that place of bliss by walking in the paths of
pleasure shall be disappointed: and therefore few reach it, because few are willing to use
violence to themselves in resisting temptations.: **_“The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence,
and the violent bear it away."_** (Matt. xi. 12.) In explaining this passage, a certain writer says:



” **_Vi queritur, invaditur, occupatur."_** It must be sought and obtained by violence: he who
wishes to obtain it without inconvenience, or by leading a soft and irregular life, shall not
acquire it he shall be excluded from it.



12. To save their souls, some of the saints have retired into the cloister; some have confined
themselves in a cave; others have embraced torments and death. ” **_The violent bear it
away”_** Some complain of their want of confidence in God; but they do not perceive that their
diffidence arises from the weakness of their resolution to serve God. St. Teresa used to say:
**_"Of irresolute souls the Devil has no fear”_** And the Wise Man has declared, that **_"desires kill
the slothful. ”_** (Prov. xxi. 25.) Some would wish to be saved and to become saints, but never
resolve to adopt the means of salvation, such as meditation, the frequentation of the
sacraments, detachment from creatures; or, if they adopt these means, they soon give them
up. In a word, they are satisfied with fruitless desires, and thus continue to live in enmity
with God, or at least in tepidity, which in the end leads them to the loss of God. Thus in them
are verified the words of the Holy Ghost, **_“desires kill the slothful."_**


13. If, then, we wish to save our souls, and to become saints, we must make a strong
resolution not only in general to give ourselves to God, but also in particular to adopt the
proper means, and never to abandon them after having once taken them up. Hence we must
never cease to pray to Jesus Christ, and to His holy Mother for holy perseverance.


**SERMON IV. FOURTH SUNDAY OF ADVENT. - ON THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST
FOR US, AND ON OUR OBLIGATIONS TO LOVE HIM.**
**_“And all flesh shall see the salvation of God." Luke iii. 6._**


THE Saviour of the world, whom, according to the prediction of the prophet Isaias, men were
one day to see on this Earth **_"and all flesh shall see the salvation of God,"_** has already come.
We have not only seen him conversing among men, but we have also seen him suffering and
dying for the love of us. Let us, then, this morning consider the love which we owe to Jesus
Christ at least through gratitude for the love which he bears to us. In the first point we shall
consider the greatness of the love which Jesus Christ has shown to us; and in the second we
shall see the greatness of our obligations to love him.


**_First Point. On the great love which Jesus Christ has shown to us._**


1. ” **_Christ,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_came on Earth that men might know how much God loves
them."_** He has come, and to show the immense love which this God bears us, he has given
himself entirely to us, by abandoning himself to all the pains of this life, and afterwards to
the scourges, to the thorns, and to all the sorrows and insults which he suffered in his
passion, and by offering himself to die, abandoned by all, on the infamous tree of the cross.
” **_Who loved me, and delivered himself for me."_** (Gal. ii. 20.)


2. Jesus Christ could save us without dying on the cross, and without suffering. One drop of
his blood would be sufficient for our redemption. Even a prayer offered to his Eternal Father
would be sufficient; because, on account of his divinity, his prayer would be of infinite value,
and would therefore be sufficient for the salvation of the world, and of a thousand worlds.
” **_But”_** says St. Chrysostom, or another ancient author, ” **_what was sufficient for redemption
was not sufficient for love."_** To show how much he loved us, he wished to shed not only a



part of his blood, but the entire of it, by dint of torments. This may be inferred from the
words which he used on the night before his death: **_"This is my blood of the new testament,
which shall be shed for many. ”_** (Matt. xxvi. 28.) The words shall be shed show that, in his
passion, the blood of Jesus Christ was poured forth even to the last drop. Hence, when after
death his side was opened with a spear, blood and water came forth, as if what then flowed
was all that remained of his blood. Jesus Christ, then, though he could save us without
suffering, wished to embrace a life of continual pain, and to suffer the cruel and ignominious
death of the cross. ” **_He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross."_** (Phil. ii. 8.)


3. ” **_Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends."_** (John
xv. 13.) To show his love for us, what more could the Son of God do than die for us? What
more can one man do for another than give his life for him? **_“Greater love than this no man
hath."_** Tell me, my brother, if one of your servants if the vilest man on this Earth had done
for you what Jesus Christ has done in dying through pain on a cross, could you remember his
love for you, and not love him?



4. St. Francis of Assisium appeared to be unable to think of anything but the passion of Jesus
Christ; and, in thinking of it, he continually shed tears, so that by his constant weeping he
became nearly blind. Being found one day weeping and groaning at the foot of the crucifix,
he was asked the cause of his tears and lamentations. He replied: ” **_I weep over the sorrows
and ignominies of my Lord. And what makes me weep still more is, that the men for whom
he has suffered so much live in forgetfulness of him."_**


5. O Christian, should a doubt ever enter your mind that Jesus Christ loves you, raise your
eyes and look at him hanging on the cross. Ah! says St. Thomas of Villanova, the cross to
which he is nailed, the internal and external sorrows which he endures, and the cruel death
which he suffers for you, are convincing proofs of the love which he bears you: **_"Testis crux,
testes dolores, testis amara mors quam pro te sustinuit."_** (Conc. 3.) Do you not, says St.
Bernard, hear the voice of that cross, and of those wounds, crying out to make you feel that
he truly loves you?” **_Clamat crux, clamat vulnus, quod vere dilexit."_**


6. St. Paul says that the love which Jesus Christ has shown in condescending to suffer so
much for our salvation, should excite us to his love more powerfully than the scourging, the
crowning with thorns, the painful journey to Calvary, the agony of three hours on the cross,
the buffets, the spitting in his face, and all the other injuries which the Saviour endured.
According to the Apostle, the love which Jesus has shown us not only obliges, but in a certain
manner forces and constrains us, to love a God who has loved us so much. ” **_For the charity
of Christ presseth us."_** ( 2 Cor. v. 14.) On this text St. Francis de Sales says: ” **_We know that
Jesus the true God has loved us so as to suffer death, and even the death of the cross, for our
salvation. Does not such love put our hearts as it were under a press, to force from them love
by a violence which is stronger in proportion as it is more amiable?_** ”


7. So great was the love which inflamed the enamoured heart of Jesus, that he not only
wished to die for our redemption, but during his whole life he sighed ardently for the day on
which he should suffer death for the love of us. Hence, during his life, Jesus used to say: ” **_I
have a baptism wherewith I am to be baptized; and how am I straitened until it be_**



**_accomplished."_** (Luke xii. 50.) In my passion I am to be baptized with the baptism of my own
blood, to wash away the sins of men. ” **_And how am I straitened!"_** How, says St. Ambrose,
explaining this passage, am I straitened by the desire of the speedy arrival of the day of my
death? Hence, on the night before his passion he said: ” **_With desire I have desired to eat this
pasch with you before I suffer."_** (Luke xxii. 1 5.)


8. ” **_We have,"_** says St. Lawrence Justinian, ” **_seen wisdom become foolish through an excess of
love."_** We have, he says, seen the Son of God become as it were a fool, through, the excessive
love which he bore to men. Such, too, was the language of the Gentiles when they heard the
apostles preaching that Jesus Christ suffered death for the love of men. ” **_But we,"_** says St.
Paul, ” **_preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews indeed a stumbling block, unto the Gentiles
foolishness."_** (1 Cor. i. 23.) Who, they exclaimed, can believe that a God, most happy in
himself, and who stands in need of no one, should take human flesh and die for the love of
men, who are his creatures? This would be to believe that a God became foolish for the love
of men. **_"It appears folly,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_that the author of Life should die for men."_**
(Hom vi.) But, whatever infidels may say or think, it is of faith that the Son of God has shed
all his blood for the love of us, to wash away the sins of our souls. ” **_Who hath loved us, and
washed us from our sins in his own blood."_** (Apoc. i. 5.) Hence, the saints were struck dumb
with astonishment at the consideration of the love of Jesus Christ. At the sight of the crucifix,
St. Francis of Paul could do nothing but exclaim, love! love! love!


9. ” **_Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end. ”_** (John xiii. 1.)
This loving Lord was not content with showing us his love by dying on the cross for our
salvation; but, at the end of his life, he wished to leave us his own very flesh for the food of
our souls, that thus he might unite himself entirely to us. ” **_Take ye and eat, this is my body."_**
(Matt. xxvi. 26.) But of this gift and this excess of love we shall speak at another time, in
treating of the most holy sacrament of the altar. Let us pass to the second point.


**_Second Point. On the greatness of our obligations to love Jesus Christ._**



10. He who loves wishes to be loved. **_“When,"_** says St. Bernard, ” **_God loves, he desires
nothing else than to be loved."_** (Ser. Ixxxiii., in Cant.) The Redeemer said: ” **_I am come to cast
fire upon the Earth, and what will I but that it is kindled”_** (Luke xii. 49.) I, says Jesus Christ,
came on earth to light up the fire of divine love in the hearts of men and what will I but that
it be kindled ?" God wishes nothing else from us than to be loved. Hence the holy Church
prays in the following words: ” **_We beseech thee, Lord, that thy Spirit may inflame us with
that fire which Jesus Christ cast upon the Earth, and which he vehemently wished to be
kindled. ”_** Ah! what have not the saints, inflamed with this fire, accomplished! They have
abandoned all things delights, honours, the purple and the sceptre that they might burn with
this holy fire. But you will ask what are you to do, that you too may be inflamed with the
love of Jesus Christ. Imitate David: ” **_In my meditation a fire shall flame out. ”_** (Ps. xxxviii).
Meditation is the blessed furnace in which the holy fire of divine love is kindled. Make
mental prayer every day, meditate on the passion of Jesus Christ, and doubt not but you too
shall burn with this blessed flame.


11. St. Paul says, that Jesus Christ died for us to make himself the master of the hearts of all.
**_“To this end Christ died and rose again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the_**



**_living."_** (Rom. xiv. 9.) He wished, says the Apostle, to give his life for all men, without a
single exception, that not even one should live any longer to himself, but that all might live
only to that God who condescended to die for them. **_“And Christ died for all, that they also
who live may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them."_** (2 Cor. v. 15.)



12. Ah! to correspond to the love of this God, it would be necessary that another God should
die for him, as Jesus Christ died for us. ingratitude of men! A God has condescended to give
his life for their salvation, and they will not even think on what he has even done for them!
Ah! if each of you thought frequently on the sufferings of the Redeemer., and on the love
which he has shown to us in his passion, how could you but love him with your whole
hearts? To him who sees with a lively faith the Son of God suspended by three nails on an
infamous gibbet, every wound of Jesus speaks and says: ” **_Thou shalt love the Lord thy God."_**
Love, man, thy Lord and thy God, who has loved thee so intensely. "Who can resist such
tender expressions?”The wounds of Jesus Christ," says St. Bonaventure, ”wound the hardest
hearts, and inflame frozen souls."


13. ”Oh! if you knew the mystery of the cross! said St. Andrew the Apostle to the tyrant by
whom he was tempted to deny Jesus Christ. tyrant, if you knew the love which your Saviour
has shown you by dying on the cross for your salvation, instead of tempting me, you would
abandon all the goods of this Earth to give yourself to the love of Jesus Christ.


14. I conclude, my most beloved brethren, by recommending you henceforth to meditate
every day on the passion of Jesus Christ. I shall be content, if you daily devote to this
meditation a quarter of an hour. Let each at least procure a crucifix, let him keep it in his
room, and from time to time give a glance at it, saying: " **_Ah! my Jesus, thou hast died for me,
and I do not love thee. ”_** Had a person suffered for a friend injuries, buffets, and prisons, he
would be greatly pleased to find that they were remembered and spoken of with gratitude.
But he should be greatly displeased if the friend for whom they had been borne, were
unwilling to think or hear of his sufferings. Thus frequent meditation on his passion is very
pleasing to our Redeemer; but the neglect of it greatly provokes his displeasure. Oh! how
great will be the consolation which we shall receive in our last moments from the sorrows
and death of Jesus Christ, if, during life, we shall have frequently meditated on them with
love! Let us not wait till others, at the hour of death, place in our hands the crucifix; let us not
wait till they remind us of all that Jesus Christ suffered for us. Let us, during life, embrace
Jesus Christ crucified; let us keep ourselves always united to him, that we may live and die
with him. He who practises devotion to the passion of our Lord, cannot but be devoted to the
dolour’s of Mary, the remembrance of which will be to us a source of great consolation at the
hour of death, how profitable and sweet the meditation of Jesus on the cross! Oh! how happy
the death of him who dies in the embraces of Jesus crucified, accepting death with
cheerfulness for the love of that God who has died for the love of us!


**SERMON V. SUNDAY WITHIN THE OCTAVE OF THE NATIVITY. - IN WHAT TRUE
WISDOM CONSISTS.**


**_" Behold, this CHILD is set for the fall and for the resurrection of many in Israel." LUKE ii.
34._**



SUCH was the language of holy Simeon when he had the consolation to hold in his hands the
infant Jesus. Among other things which he then foretold, he declared that **_"this child was set
for the fall and for the resurrection of many in Israel."_** In these words he extols the lot of the
saints, who, after this life, shall rise to a life of immortality in the kingdom of bliss, and he
deplores the misfortune of sinners, who, for the transitory and miserable pleasures of this
world, bring upon themselves eternal ruin and perdition. But, notwithstanding the greatness
of his own misery, the unhappy sinner, reflecting only on the enjoyment of present goods,
calls the saints fools, because they seek to live in poverty, in humiliation, and self-denial. But
a day will come when sinners shall see their errors, and shall say. **_“We fools esteemed their
life madness, and their end without honour."_** (Wis. v. 4.) We fools; behold how they shall
confess that they themselves have been truly fools. Let us examine in what true wisdom
consists, and we shall see, in the first point, that sinners are truly foolish, and, in the second,
that the saints are truly wise.


**_First Point. Sinners are truly foolish._**



1. What greater folly can be conceived than to have the power of being the friends of God,
and to wish to be his enemies? Their living in enmity with God makes the life of sinners
unhappy in this world, and purchases for them an eternity of misery hereafter St. Augustine
relates that two courtiers of the emperor entered a monastery of hermits, and that one of
them began to read the life of St. Anthony. **_"He read, ”_** says the saint, **_"and his heart was
divested of the world."_** He read, and, in reading, his affections were detached from the Earth.
Turning to his companion he exclaimed: ” **_What do we seek? The friendship of the emperor is
the most we can hope for. And through how many perils shall we arrive at still greater
danger? Should we obtain his friendship, how long shall it last ?"_** Friend, said he, fools that
we are, what do we seek? Can we expect more in this life, by serving the emperor, than to
gain his friendship? And should we, after many dangers, succeed in making him our friend,
we shall expose ourselves to greater danger of eternal perdition. What difficulties must we
encounter in order to become the friend of Caesar!” **_But, if I wish, I can in a moment become
the friend of God."_** I can acquire his friendship by endeavouring to recover his grace. His
divine grace is that infinite treasure which makes us worthy of his friendship. **_“For she is an
infinite treasure to men, which they that use become the friends of God”_** (Wis. vii. 14.)


2. The Gentiles believe it impossible for a creature to become the friend of God; for, as St.
Jerome says, **_friendship makes friends equal. "Amicitia pares accipit, aut pares facit."_** But
Jesus Christ has declared, that if we observe his commands we shall be his friends. **_“You are
my friends, if you do the things I command."_** (John xv. 14.)


3. How great then is the folly of sinners, who, though they have it in their power to enjoy the
friendship of God, wish to live in enmity with him! The Lord does not hate any of his
creatures: he does not hate the tiger, the viper, or the toad. ” **_For thou lovest all things that
are, and hatest none of the things which thou hast made."_** (Wis. xi. 25.) But he necessarily
hates sinners. ” **_Thou hatest all the workers of iniquity."_** (Ps. v. 7.) God cannot but hate sin,
which is his enemy and diametrically opposed to his will; and therefore, in hating sin, he
necessarily hates the sinner who is united with his sin. **_“But to God the wicked and his
wickedness are hateful alike. ”_** (Wis. xiv. 9.)





4. The sinner is guilty of folly in leading a life opposed to the end for which he was created.
God has not created us, nor does he preserve our lives, that we may labour to acquire riches
or earthly honours, or that we may indulge in amusements, but that we may love and serve
him in this world, in order to love and enjoy him for eternity in the next. **_“And the end life
everlasting."_** (Rom. vi. 22.) Thus the present life, as St. Gregory says, is the way by which we
must reach Paradise, our true country. ” **_In the present life we are, as it were, on the road by
which we journey to our country." (_** St. Greg. hom. xi. in Evan.)


5. But the misfortune of the greater part of mankind is, that instead of following the way of
salvation, they foolishly walk in the road to perdition,. Some have a passion for earthly
riches; and, for a vile interest, they lose the immense goods of Paradise: others have a passion
for honours; and, for a momentary applause, they lose their right to be kings in Heaven:
others have a passion for sensual pleasures; and, for transitory de lights, they lose the grace
of God, and are condemned to burn for ever in a prison of fire. Miserable souls! if, in
punishment of a certain sin, their hand was to be burned with a red-hot iron, or if they were
to be shut up for ten years in a dark prison, they certainly would abstain from it. And do they
not know that, in chastisement of their sins, they shall be condemned to remain for ever in
Hell, where their bodies, buried in fire, shall burn for all eternity? **_Some,_** says St. John
Chrysostom (Hom. de recup. Laps.), **_to save the body, choose to destroy the soul; but, do
they not know that, in losing the soul, their bodies shall be condemned to eternal
torments?”If we neglect the soul, we cannot save the body"_**


6. In a word, sinners lose their reason, and imitate brute animals, that follow the instinct of
nature, and seek carnal pleasures without ever reflecting on their lawfulness or unlawfulness.
But to act in this manner is, according to St. Chrysostom, to act not like a man, but like a
beast. ” **_Hominem ilium dicimus"_** says the saint, **_"qui imaginem hominis salvam retinet: qua
autem est imago hominis? Rationalem esse" To be men we must be rational: that is, we must
act, not according to the sensual appetite, but according to the dictates of reason._** If God
gave to beasts the use of reason, and if they acted according to its rules, we should say that
they acted like men. And it must, on the other hand, be said, that the man whose conduct is
agreeable to the senses, but contrary to reason, acts like a beast. He who follows the dictates
of reason, provides for the future. **_"Oh! that they would be wise, and would understand, and
would provide for their last end."_** (Deuter. xxxii. 29.) He looks to the future that is, to the
account he must render at the hour of death, after which he shall be doomed to Hell or to
Heaven, according to his merits, ” **_Non est sapiens”_** says St. Bernard, ” **_qui sibi non est_** ." (Lib.
de consid.)


7. Sinners think only of the present, but regard not the end for which they were created. But
what will it profit them to gain all things if they lose their last end, which alone can make
them happy. ” **_But one thing is necessary."_** (Luke x. 42.) To attain our end is the only thing
necessary for us: if we lose it, all is lost. What is this end? It is eternal life. **_“Finem vero vitam
æternam."_** During life, sinners care but little for the attainment of their end. Each day brings
them nearer to death and to eternity; but they know not their destination. **_Should a pilot who
is asked whither he is going, answer that he did not know, would not all, says St. .Augustine,
cry out that he was bringing the vessel to destruction?”Fac hominem perdidisse quo tendit, et
dicatur ei: quo is? et dicat, nescio: nonne iste navem ad naufragium perducet ?"_** The saint
then adds: ” **_Talis est qui currit præter viam."_** Such are the wise of the world, who know how



to acquire wealth and honours, and to indulge in every kind of amusement, but who know
not how to save their souls. How miserable the rich glutton, who, though able to lay up
riches and to live splendidly, was, after death, buried in Hell! How miserable Alexander the
Great, who, after gaining so many kingdoms, was condemned to eternal torments? How
great the folly of Henry the Eighth, who rebelled against the Church, but seeing at the hour
of death that his soul should be lost, cried out in despair: ” **_Friends, we have lost all!"_** O God,
how many others now weep in Hell, and exclaim: ” **_What hath pride profited us? or what
advantage hath the toasting of riches brought us? All those things are passed away like a
shadow."_** (Wis. v. 8.) In the world we made a great figure we enjoyed abundant riches and
honours; and now all is passed away like a shadow, and nothing remains for us but to suffer
and weep for eternity. St. Augustine says, that the happiness which sinners enjoy in this life
is their greatest misfortune, **_“Nothing is more calamitous than the felicity of sinners, by
which their perverse will, like an internal enemy, is strengthened."_** (Ep. v. ad Marcellin.)



8. In fine, the words of Solomon are fulfilled with regard to all who neglect their salvation:
” **_Mourning taketh hold of the end of joy."_** (Prov. xiv. 13.) All their pleasures, honours, and
greatness, end in eternal sorrow and wailing. **_“Whilst I was yet beginning, he cut me off."_** (Is.
xxxviii. 12.) Whilst they are laying the foundation of their hopes of realizing a fortune, death
comes, and, cutting the thread of life, deprives them of all their possessions, and sends them
to Hell to burn for ever in a pit of fire. What greater folly can be conceived, than to wish to be
transformed from the friend of God into the slave of Lucifer, and from the heir of Paradise to
become, by sin, doomed to Hell? For, the moment a Christian commits a mortal sin, his name
is written among the number of the damned! St. Francis de Sales said that, if the angels were
capable of weeping, they would do nothing else than shed tears at the sight of the destruction
which a Christian who com mits mortal sin brings upon himself.


9. Oh! how great is the folly of sinners, who, by living in sin, lead a life of misery and
discontent! All the goods of this world cannot content the heart of man, which has been
created to love God, and can find no peace out of God. What are all the grandeurs and all the
pleasures of this world but **_"vanity of vanities!"_** (Eccl. i. 2.) What are they but **_“vanity and
vexation of spirit?”_** (Ibid. iv. 16.) Earthly goods are, according to Solomon, who had
experience of them, vanity of vanities; that is mere vanities, lies, and deceits. They are also
a”vexation of spirit :" they not only do not content, but they even afflict the soul; and the
more abundantly they are possessed, the greater the anguish which they produce. Sinners
hope to find peace in their sins; but what peace can they enjoy?” **_There is no peace to the
wicked, saith the Lord."_** (Is. xlviii. 22.) I abstain from saying more at present on the unhappy
life of sinners: I shall speak of it in another place. At present, it is enough for you to know
that God gives peace to the souls who love him, and not to those who despise him. Instead of
seeking to be the friends of God, sinners wish to be the slaves of Satan, who is a **_cruel and
merciless tyrant_** to all who submit to his yoke. **_"Crudelis est et non miserebitur."_** (Jer. vi. 23.)
And if he promises delights, he does it, as St. Cyprian says, not for our welfare, but that we
may be the companions of his torments in hell: ” **_Ut habeat socios pœna, socios gehenæ”._**


**_Second Point. The saints are truly wise._**


10. Let us be persuaded that the truly wise are those who know how to love God and to gain
Heaven. Happy the man to whom God has given the science of the saints. **_"Dedit illi_**



**_scientiam sanctorum”_** (Wis. x. 10.) Oh! how sublime the science which teaches us to know
how to love God and to save our souls! Happy, says St. Augustine, is the man **_"who knows
God, although he is ignorant of other things."_** They who know God, the love which he
merits, and how to love him, stand not in need of any other knowledge. They are wiser than
those who are masters of many sciences, but know not how to love God. Brother Egidius, of
the order of St. Francis, once said to St. Bonaventure: **_Happy you, Father Bonaventure, who
are so learned, and who, by your learning, can become more holy than I can, who am a poor
ignorant man. Listen, replied the saint: if an old woman knows how to love God better than
I do, she is more learned and more holy than I am._** At hearing this, Brother Egidius
exclaimed: ” **_poor old woman! poor old woman! Father Bonaventure says that, if you love
God more than he does, you can surpass him in sanctity."_**



11. This excited the envy of St. Augustine, and made him ashamed of himself. ” **_Surgunt
indocti,"_** he exclaimed, **_"et rapiunt cœlum."_** Alas! the ignorant rise up, and bear away the
kingdom of Heaven; and what are we, the learned of this world, doing? Oh! how many of the
rude and illiterate are saved, because, though unable to read, they know how to love God;
and how many of the wise of the world are damned! Oh! truly wise were St. John of God, St.
Felix of the order of St. Capuchins, and St. Paschal, who were poor lay Franciscans, and
unacquainted with human sciences, but learned in the science of the saints. But the wonder
is, that, though worldlings themselves are fully persuaded of this truth, and constantly extol
the merit of those who retire from the world to live only to God, still they act as if they
believed it not.


12. Tell me, brethren, to which class do you wish to belong to the wise of the world, or to the
wise of God? Before you make a choice, St. Chrysostom advises you to go to the graves of the
dead! **_"Proficiscamur ad Sepulchra”_** Oh! how eloquently do the sepulchres of the dead teach
us the science of the saints and the vanity of all earthly goods!” **_For my part,"_** said the saint, ” **_I
see nothing but rottenness, bones, and worms. ”_** As if he said: Among these skeletons I
cannot distinguish the noble, the rich, or the learned; I see that they have all become dust and
rottenness: thus all their greatness and glory have passed away like a dream.


13. What then must we do? Behold the advice of St. Paul: **_"This, therefore, I say, brethren: the
time is short: it remaineth that... they that use this world BE as if they used it not; for the
fashion of this world passeth away."_** (1 Cor. vii. 29-31.) This world is a scene which shall
pass away and end very soon. **_"The time is short."_** During the days of life that remain, let us
endeavour to live like men who are wise, not according to the world, but according to God,
by attending to the sanctification of our souls, and by adopting the means of salvation; by
flying dangerous occasions; by practising prayer; joining some pious sodality; frequenting
the sacraments; reading every day a spiritual book; and by daily hearing Mass, if it be in our
power; or, at least, by visiting Jesus in the holy sacrament of the altar, and some image of the
most holy Mary. Thus we shall be truly wise, and shall be happy for time and eternity.


**SERMON VI. MALICE OF MORTAL SIN.**
**_" Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 1 LUKE ii. 48._**


MOST holy Mary lost her Son for three days: during that time she wept continually for
having lost sight of Jesus, and did not cease to seek after him till she found him. How then



does it happen that so many sinners not only lose sight of Jesus, but even lose his divine
grace; and instead of weeping for so great a loss, sleep in peace, and make no effort to recover
so great a blessing? This arises from their not feeling what it is to lose God by sin. Some say: I
commit this sin, not to lose God, but to enjoy this pleasure, to possess the property of
another, or to take revenge of an enemy. They who speak such language show that they do
not understand the malice of mortal sin. What is mortal sin?
**_First Point. It is a great contempt shown to God.
Second Point. It is a great offence offered to God._**


**_First Point. Mortal sin is a great contempt shown to God._**



1. The Lord calls upon Heaven and Earth to detest the ingratitude of those who commit
mortal sin, after they had been created by him, nourished with his blood, and exalted to the
dignity of his adopted children. ” **_Hear, O ye Heavens, and give ear, Earth; for the Lord hath
spoken. I have brought up children _ and exalted them; but they have despised me."_** (Isa. i. 2.)
Who is this God whom sinners despise?; **_He is a God of infinite majesty, before whom all the
kings of the Earth and all the blessed in Heaven are less than a drop of water or a grain of
sand. As a drop of a bucket,... as a little dust. ”_** (Isa. xl. 15.) In a word, such is the majesty of
God, that in his presence all creatures are as if they did not exist. ” **_All nations are before him
as if they had no being at all."_** (Ibid. xl. 17.) And what is man, who insults him? St. Bernard
answers: ” **_Saccus vermium, cibus vermium." A heap of worms, the food of worms,_** by which
he shall be devoured in the grave. ”Thou art wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind,
and naked." (Apoc. iii. 17.) He is so miserable that he can do nothing, so blind that he knows
nothing, and so poor that he possesses nothing. And this worm dares to despise a God, and
to provoke his wrath. ” **_Vile dust,"_** says the same saint, ” **_dares to irritate such tremendous
majesty."_** Justly, then, has St. Thomas asserted, that the malice of mortal sin is, as it were,
infinite: ” **_Peccatum habet quandam infinitatem malitiae ex infinitatem divine majestatis."_**
(Par. 3, q. 2, a. 2, ad. 2.) And St. Augustine calls it an infinite evil. Hence Hell and a thousand
Hells are not sufficient chastisement for a single mortal sin.


2. Mortal sin is commonly defined by theologians to be” **_a turning away from the immutable
good."_** St. Thom., par. 1, q. 24, a. 4; a turning ones back on the sovereign good. Of this God
complains by his prophet, saying: ” **_Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord; thou art gone
backward. ”_** (Jer. xv. 6.) Ungrateful man, he says to the sinner, I would never have separated
myself from thee; thou hast been the first to abandon me: thou art gone backwards; thou hast
turned thy back upon me.


3. He who contemns the divine law despises God; because he knows that, by despising the
law, he loses the divine grace. **_"By transgression of the law, thou dishonourest God."_** (Rom.
ii. 23.) God is the Lord of all things, because he has created them. ” **_All things are in thy
power... Thou hast made Heaven and Earth."_** (Esth. xiii. 9.) Hence all irrational creatures the
winds, the sea, the fire, and rain obey God, ” **_The winds and the sea obey him."_** (Matt. viii.
27.)” **_Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds, which fulfil his word."_** (Ps. cxlviii. 8.) But man, when
he sins, says to God: Lord, thou dost command me, but I will not obey; thou dost command
me to pardon such an injury, but I will resent it; thou dost command me to give up the
property of others, but I will retain it; thou dost wish that I should abstain from such a
forbidden pleasure, but I will indulge in it. ” **_Thou hast broken my yoke, thou hast burst my_**



**_bands, and thou saidst: I will not serve."_** (Jer. ii. 20.) In fine, the sinner when he breaks the
command, says to God: I do not acknowledge thee for my Lord. Like Pharaoh, when Moses,
on the part of God, commanded him in the name of the Lord to allow the people to go into
the desert, the sinner answers: **_"Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel
go ?"_** (Exod. v. 2.)



4. The insult offered to God by sin is heightened by the vileness of the goods for which
sinners offend him. ” **_Wherefore hath the wicked provoked God."_** (Ps. x. 13.) For what do so
many offend the Lord? For a little vanity; for the indulgence of anger; or for a beastly
pleasure. ” **_They violate me among my people for a handful of barley and a piece of bread."_**
(Ezec. xiii. 19.) God is insulted for a handful of barley for a morsel of bread! God! why do we
allow ourselves to be so easily deceived by the Devil?” **_There is,"_** says the Prophet Osee, **_“a
deceitful balance in his hand."_** (xii. 7.) We do not weigh things in the balance of God, which
cannot deceive, but in the balance of Satan, who seeks only to deceive us, that he may bring
us with himself into Hell. ” **_Lord,"_** said David, ” **_who is like to thee ?"_** (Ps. xxxiv. 10.) God is an
infinite good; and when he sees sinners put him on a level with some earthly trifle, or with a
miserable gratification, he justly complains in the language of the prophet: ” **_To whom, have
you likened me or made me equal? saith the Holy One."_** (Isa. xl. 25.) In your estimation, a vile
pleasure is more valuable than my grace. Is it a momentary satisfaction you have preferred
before me?” **_Thou hast cast me off behind thy back."_** (Ezec. xxiii. 35.) Then, adds Salvian,
” **_there is no one for whom men have less esteem than for God."_** (Lib. v., Avd. Avar.) Is the
Lord so contemptible in your eyes as to deserve to have the miserable things of the Earth
preferred before him?


5. The tyrant placed before St. Clement a heap of gold, of silver, and of gems, and promised
to give them to the holy martyr if he would renounce the faith of Christ. The saint heaved a
sigh of sorrow at the sight of the blindness of men, who put earthly riches in comparison
with God. But many sinners exchange the divine grace for things of far less value; they seek
after certain miserable goods, and abandon that God who is an infinite good, and who alone
can make them happy. Of this the Lord complains, and calls on the Heavens to be astonished,
and on its gates to be struck with horror: ” **_Be astonished O ye Heavens, at this; and ye gates
thereof, be very desolate, saith the Lord."_** He then adds: ” **_For my people have done two evils:
they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns
broken cisterns that can hold no water."_** (Jer. ii. 12 and 13.) We regard with wonder and
amazement the injustice of the Jews, who, when Pilate offered to deliver Jesus or Barabbas,
answered: ” **_Not this man, but Barabbas."_** (John xviii. 40.) The conduct of sinners is still
worse; for, when the Devil proposes to them to choose between the satisfaction of revenge a
miserable pleasure and Jesus Christ, they answer: **_"Not this man, but Barabbas."_** That is, not
the Lord Jesus, but sin.


6. ” **_There shall be no new God in thee,"_** says the Lord. (Ps. Ixxx. 10.) You shall not abandon
me, your true God, and make for yourself a new god, whom you shall serve. St. Cyprian
teaches that **_men make their god whatever they prefer before God, by making it their last end;
for God is the only last end of all: ”Quidquid homo Deo anteponit, Deum sibi facit."_** And St.
Jerome says: ” **_Unusquisque quod cupit, si veneratur, hoc illi Deus est. Vitium in corde, est
idolum in altari."_** (In Ps. Ixxx.) The creature which a person prefers to God, becomes his God.
Hence, the holy doctor adds, that as the Gentiles adored idols on their altars, so sinners



worship sin in their hearts. When King Jeroboam rebelled against God, he endeavoured to
make the people imitate him in the adoration of idols. He one day placed the idols before
them, and said: **_"Behold thy gods, Israel!"_** (3 Kings xii. 28.) The Devil acts in a similar manner
towards sinners: he places before them such a gratification, and says: Make this your God.
Behold! this pleasure, this money, this revenge is your God: adhere to these, and forsake the
Lord. When the sinner consents to sin, he abandons his Creator, and in his heart adores as his
god the pleasure which lie indulges. ” **_Vitium in corde est idolum in altari. ”_**



7. The contempt which the sinner offers to God is increased by sinning in God’s presence.
According to St. Cyril of Jerusalem, some adored the sun as their god, that during the night
they might, in the absence of the sun, do what they pleased, without fear of divine
chastisement. **_"Some regarded the sun as their God, that, after the setting of the sun, they
might be without a God."_** (Catech. iv.) The conduct of these miserable dupes was very
criminal; but they were careful not to sin in presence of their god. But Christians know that
God is present in all places, and that he sees all things. ” **_Do not I fill Heaven and Earth? saith
the Lord,"_** (Jer. xxiii. 24); and still they do not abstain from insulting him, and from
provoking his wrath in his very presence: **_“A people that continually provoke me to anger
before my face."_** (Isa. Ixv. 3.) Hence, by sinning before him who is their judge, they even
make God a witness of their iniquities: ” **_I am the judge and the witness, saith the Lord."_** (Jer.
xxix. 23.) St. Peter Chrysologus says, that, **_“the man who commits a crime in the presence of
his judge, can offer no defence."_** The thought of having offended God in his divine presence,
made David weep and exclaim: ” **_To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee."_**
(Ps. i. 6.) But let us pass to the second point, in which we shall see more clearly the enormity
of the malice of mortal sin.


**_Second Point. Mortal sin is a great offence offered to God._**


8. There is nothing more galling than to see oneself despised by those who were most
beloved and most highly favoured. Whom do sinners insult? They insult a God who
bestowed so many benefits upon them, and who loved them so as to die on a cross for their
sake; and by the commission of mortal sin they banish that God from their hearts. A soul that
loves God is loved by him, and God himself comes to dwell within her. ” **_If any one love me,
he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make
our abode with him."_** (John xiv. 23.) The Lord, then, never departs from a soul, unless he is
driven away, even though he should know that she will soon banish him from her heart.
According to the Council of Trent, ” **_he deserts not the soul, unless he is deserted."_**


9. When the soul consents to mortal sin she ungratefully says to God: Depart from me. **_“The
wicked have said to God: Depart from us."_** (Job xxi. 14.) Sinners, as St. Gregory observes, say
the same, not in words, but by their conduct. ” **_Recede, non verbis, sed moribus."_** They know
that God cannot remain with sin in the soul: and, in violating the divine commands, they feel
that God must depart; and, by their acts they say to him: since you cannot remain any longer
with us, depart farewell. And through the very door by which God departs from the soul, the
Devil enters to take possession of her. When the priest baptizes an infant, he commands the
demon to depart from the soul: ” **_Go out from him, unclean spirits, and make room for the
Holy Ghost."_** But when a Christian consents to mortal sin, he says to God: **_Depart from me;
make room for the_**



**_Devil, whom I wish to serve._**



10. St. Bernard says, that mortal sin is so opposed to God, that, **_if it were possible for God to
die, sin would deprive him of life;”Peccatum quantum in se est Deum perimit."_** Hence,
according to Job, in committing mortal sin, man rises up against God, and stretches forth his
hand against him: ” **_For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and hath strengthened
himself against the Almighty."_** (Job. xv. 25.)


11. According to the same St. Bernard, they who wilfully violate the divine law, seek to
deprive God of life in proportion to the malice of their will;” **_Quantum in ipsa est Deum
perimit propria voluntas."_** (Ser. iii. de Res.) Because, adds the saint, self-will” **_would wish
God to see its own sins, and to be unable to take vengeance on them."_** Sinners know that the
moment they consent to mortal sin, God condemns them to Hell. Hence, being firmly
resolved to sin, they wish that there was no God, and, consequently, they would wish to take
away his life, that he might not be able to avenge their crime. “ **_He hath,"_** continues Job, in his
description of the wicked, ” **_run against him witb his neck raised up, and is armed with a fat
neck."_** (xv. 26.) The sinner raises his neck; that is, his pride swells up, and he runs to insult his
God; and, because he contends with a powerful antagonist, ” **_he is armed with a fat neck."“A
fat neck"_** is the symbol of ignorance, of that ignorance which makes the sinner say: This is not
a great sin; God is merciful; we are flesh; the Lord will have pity on us. O temerity! illusion!
which brings so many Christians to Hell.


Moreover, the man who commits a mortal sin afflicts the heart of God. **_“But they provoked to
wrath, and afflicted the spirit of the Holy One."_** (Isaias Ixiii. 10.) "What pain and anguish
would you not feel, if you knew that a person whom you tenderly loved, and on whom you
bestowed great favours, had sought to take away your life! God is not capable of pain; but,
were he capable of suffering, a single mortal sin would be sufficient to make him die through
sorrow. ” **_Mortal sin,"_** says Father Medina, ” **_if it were possible, would destroy God himself:
because it would be the cause of infinite sadness to God."_** As often, then, as you committed
mortal sin, you would, if it were possible, have caused God to die of sorrow; because you
knew that by sin you insulted him and turned your back upon him, after he had bestowed so
many favours upon you, and even after he had given all his blood and his life for your
salvation.
(An act of sorrow, etc.}


**SERMON VII. SECOND SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY. - ON THE CONFIDENCE
WITH WHICH WE OUGHT TO RECOMMEND OURSELVES TO THE MOTHER OF
GOD**


**_“And the wine failing, the Mother of Jesus saith to him: They have no wine” JOHN ii. 3._**


IN the Gospel of this day we read that Jesus Christ, having been invited, went with his holy
mother to a marriage of Cana of Galilee. ”The wine failing, Mary said to her divine Son:
” **_They have no wine."_** By these words she intended to ask her Son to console the spouses,
who were afflicted because the wine had failed. Jesus answered: "Woman, what is it to me
and to thee? my hour is not yet come." (John ii. 4.) He meant that the time destined for the
performance of miracles was that of his preaching through Judea. But, though his answer



appeared to be a refusal of the request of Mary, the Son, says St. Chrysostom, resolved to
yield to the desire of the mother. ” **_Although he said, my hour is not yet come, he granted the
petition of his mother."_** (Hom, in ii. Joan.) Mary said to the waiters: ” **_Whatever he shall say
to you, do ye."_** Jesus bid them fill the water-pots with water the water was changed into the
most excellent wine. Thus the bride groom and the entire family were filled with gladness.
From the fact related in this day’s gospel, let us consider, in the first point, the greatness of
Mary’s power to obtain from God the graces which we stand in need of; and in the second,
the tenderness of Mary’s compassion, and her readiness to assist us all in our wants.


*** In a notice to the reader, prefixed to the Glories of Mary, St. Alphonsus explains the sense in which he wished his doctrine regarding
the privileges of the Blessed Virgin to be understood. He concludes this explanation in the following words: "Then, to say all in a few
words, the God of all holiness, in order to glorify the Mother of the Redeemer, has decreed and ordained, that her great charity should
pray for all those for whom her Divine Son has paid and offered the most superabundant price of his precious blood, in which alone is
our salvation, life, and resurrection? And on the foundation of this doctrine, and inasmuch as they accord with it, I have intended to lay
down my propositions, which the saints, in their affectionate colloquies with Mary, and in their fervent discourses upon her, have not
hesitated to assert." Glories of Mary. Monza Edition, vol. i., pp. 11, 12.
In the third chapter of the first volume (pp. 123, 124), St. Alphonsus compares the hope which we place in the Blessed Virgin to the
confidence which a person has in a minister of state whom he asks to procure a favour from his sovereign. "Whatsoever Mary obtains
for us, she obtains it through the merits of Jesus Christ, and because she prays in the name of Jesus Christ." Glories of Mary, vol. i., p.**


**188. “Mary, then, is said to be omnipotent in the manner in which omnipotence can be understood of a creature; for a creature is
incapable of a divine attribute. Thus she is omnipotent, inasmuch as she obtains by her prayers whatever she asks. ”Ibid., p. 223. To
obtain favours through the intercession of Mary, by practising devout exercises in her honour, "the first condition is, that we perform
our devotions with a soul free from sin, or, at least, with a desire to give up sin." "If a person wish to commit sin with the hope of being
saved by the Blessed Virgin, he shall thus render himself unworthy and incapable of her protection." Glories of Mary, vol. ii., pp. 325,
326.**


**_First Point. The greatness of Mary‟s power to obtain from God for us all the graces we stand
in need of._**


1. So great is Mary’s merit in the eyes of God, that, according to St. Bonaventure, her prayers
are infallibly heard. **_"The merit of Mary is so great before God, that her petition cannot be
rejected."_** (De Virg., c. iii.) But why are the prayers of Mary so powerful in the sight of God?
It is, says St. Antonine, because she is his mother. **_“The petition of the mother of God
partakes of the nature of a command, and therefore it is impossible that she should not be
heard."_** (Par. 4, tit. 13, c. xvii., 4.) The prayers of the saints are the prayers of servants; but the
prayers of Mary are the prayers of a mother, and therefore, according to the holy doctor, they
are regarded in a certain manner as commands by her Son, who loves her so tenderly. It is
then impossible that the prayers of Mary should be rejected.


2. Hence, according to Cosmas of Jerusalem, the intercession of Mary is all-powerful.
” **_Omnipotens auxilium tuum, Maria”_** It is right, as Richard of St. Lawrence teaches, that the
son should impart his power to the mother. Jesus Christ, who is all-powerful, has made Mary
omnipotent, as far as a creature is capable of omnipotence; that is, omnipotent in obtaining
from him, her divine Son, whatever she asks. ” **_Cum autem eadem sit potestas filii et matris
ab omnipotente filio, omnipotens mater facta est."_** (Lib. 4, de Laud. Virg.)


3. St. Bridget heard our Saviour one day addressing the Virgin in the following words: ” **_Ask
from me whatever you wish, for your petition cannot be fruitless."_** (Rev. 1. 1, cap. iv.) My
mother, ask of me what you please; I cannot reject any prayer which you present to
me;” **_because since you refused me nothing on earth, I will refuse you nothing in Heaven."_**
(Ibid.) St. George, Archbishop of Nicomedia, says that **_Jesus Christ hears all the prayers of
his mother, as if he wished thereby to discharge the obligation which he owes to her for
having given to him his human nature, by consenting to accept him for her Son. ”Filius,_**



**_exolvens debitum petitiones tuas implet."_** (Orat. de Exitu Mar.) Hence, St. Methodius,
martyr, used to say to Mary: ” **_Euge, euge, quæ debitorum habeas filium, Deo enim universi
debemus, tibi autem ille debitor est."_** (Orat, Hyp. Dom.) **_Rejoice, rejoice, holy virgin; for thou
hast for thy debtor that Son to whom we are all debtors; to thee he owes the human nature
which he received from thee._**



4. St. Gregory of Nicomedia encourages sinners by the assurance that, if they have recourse to
the Virgin with a determination to amend their lives, she will save them by her intercession.
Hence, turning to Mary, he exclaimed: **_"Thou hast insuperable strength, lest the multitude of
our sins should overcome thy clemency."_** O mother of God, the sins of a Christian, however
great they may be, cannot overcome thy mercy. **_“Nothing,"_** adds the same saint, ” **_resists thy
power; for the Creator regards thy glory as his own." Nothing is impossible to thee,_** says St.
Peter Damian: **_thou canst raise even those who are in despair to hopes of salvation. ”Nihil
tibi impossibile, quæ etiam desperates in spem salutis potes relevare."_** (Ser. i. de Nat. B.V.)


5. Richard of St. Lawrence remarks that, in announcing to the Virgin that God has chosen her
for the mother of his Son, the Archangel Gabriel said to her: **_“Fear not, Mary; for thou hast
found grace with God."_** (Luke i. 30.) From which words the same author concludes:
” **_Cupientes invenire gratiam, quæramus inventricem gratiæ." If we wish to recover lost
grace, let us seek Mary, by whom this grace has been found._** She never lost the divine grace;
she always possessed it. If the angel declared that she had found grace, he meant that she had
found it not for herself, but for us miserable sinners, who have lost it. Hence Cardinal Hugo
exhorts us to go to Mary, and say to her: O blessed lady, property should be restored to those
who lost it: the grace which thou hast found is not thine for thou hast never lost the grace of
God but it is ours; we have lost it through our own fault: to us, then, thou oughtest to restore
it. **_"Sinners, who by your sins have forfeited the divine grace, run to the Virgin, and say to her
with confidence: Restore us to our property, which thou hast found."_**


6. It was revealed to St. Gertrude, that all the graces which we ask of God through the
intercession of Mary, shall be given to us. She heard Jesus saying to his divine mother:
**_“Through thee all who ask mercy with a purpose of amending their lives, shall obtain grace."_**
If all Paradise asked a favour of God, and Mary asked the opposite grace, the Lord would
hear Mary, and would reject the petition of the rest of the celestial host. Because, says Father
Suarez, ” **_God loved the Virgin alone more than all the other saints."_** Let us, then, conclude
this first point in the words of St. Bernard: ” **_Let us seek grace, and let us seek it through
Mary; for she is a mother, and her petition cannot be rejected."_** (Serm. de Aquæd.) Let us
seek through Mary all the graces we desire to receive from God, and we shall obtain them;
for she is a mother, and her son cannot refuse to hear her prayers, or to grant the graces
which she asks from him.


**_Second Point. On the tender compassion of Mary, and her readiness to assist us in all our
wants._**


7. The tenderness of Mary’s mercy may be inferred from the fact related in this day’s Gospel.
The wine fails the spouses are troubled no one speaks to Mary to ask her Son to console them
in their necessity. But the tenderness of Mary’s heart, which, according to St. Bernardine of
Sienna, cannot but pity the afflicted, moved her to take the office of advocate, and, without



being asked, to entreat her Son to work a miracle. ” **_Unasked, she assumed the office of an
advocate and a compassionate helper."_** (Tom. 3, ser. ix.) Hence, adds the same saint, **_if,
unasked, this good lady has done so much, what will she not do for those who invoke her
intercession? "Si hoc non rogata perfecit, quid rogata perficiet ?"_**



8. From the fact already related, St. Bonaventure draws another argument to show the great
graces which we may hope to obtain through Mary, now that she reigns in Heaven. If she
was so compassionate on earth, how much greater must be her mercy now that she is in
Paradise?” **_Great was the mercy of Mary while in exile on earth; but it is much greater now
that she is a queen in Heaven; because she now sees the misery of men."_** (St. Bona. in Spec.
Virg., cap. viii.) Mary in Heaven enjoys the vision of God; and therefore she sees our wants
far more clearly than when she was on earth; hence, as her pity for us is increased, so also is
her desire to assist us more ardent. How truly has Richard of St. Victor said to the Virgin: **_“So
tender is thy heart that thou canst not see misery and not afford succour."_** It is impossible for
this loving mother to behold a human being in distress without extending to him pity and
relief.


9. St. Peter Damian says that the Virgin” **_loves us with an invincible love."_** (Ser, i. de Nat.
Virg.) How ardently soever the saints may have loved this amiable queen, their affection fell
far short of the love which Mary bore to them. It is this love that makes her so solicitous for
our welfare. The saints in Heaven, says St. Augustine, have great power to obtain grace from
God for those who recommend themselves to their prayers; but as Mary is of all the saints the
most powerful, so she is of all the most desirous to procure for us the divine mercy: ” **_Sicut
omnibus sanctis potentior, sic omnibus est pro nobis sollicitior_** ."


1 0. And, as this our great advocate once said to St. Bridget, she regards not the iniquities of
the sinner who has recourse to her, but the disposition with which he invokes her aid. If he
comes to her with a firm purpose of amendment she receives him, and by her intercession
heals his wounds, and brings him to salvation. ” **_However great a mans ,sins may be, if he
shall return to me, I am ready instantly to receive him. Nor do I regard the number or the
enormity of his sins, but the will with which he comes to me; for I do not disdain to anoint
and heal his wounds, because I am called, and truly am, the mother of mercy."_**


11. The blessed Virgin is called a”fair olive tree in the plains:" "Quasi oliva speciosa in
campis." (Eccl. xxiv. 19.) From the olive, oil only comes forth; and from the hands of Mary
only graces and mercies flow. According to Cardinal Hugo, it is said that she remains in the
plains, to show that she is ready to assist all those who have recourse to her: ”Speciosa in
campis ut omnes ad earn confugiant." In the Old Law there were five cities of refuge, in
which not all, but only those who had committed certain crimes, could find an asylum; but in
Mary, says St. John Damascene, all criminals, whatever may be their offences, may take
refuge. Hence he calls her”the city of refuge for all who have recourse to her." Why, then,
says St. Bernard, should we be afraid to approach Mary? She is all sweetness and clemency;
in her there is nothing austere or terrible: ” **_Quid ad Mariam accedere trepidat humana
fragilitas? Nihil austerum in ea, nihil terribile, tota sauvis est."_**


12. St. Bonaventure used to say that, in turning to Mary, he saw mercy itself receiving him.
**_“When I behold thee, O my lady, I see nothing but mercy. ”_** The Virgin said one day to St.



Bridget: ” **_Miser erit, qui ad misericordiam cum possit, non accedit." Miserable and miserable
for eternity shall be the sinner who, though he has it in his power during life to come to me,
who am able and willing to assist him, neglects to invoke my aid, and is lost, ”The
devil”_** says St. Peter, ” **_as a roaring lion goeth about seeing whom he may devour."_** (1 Pet. v. 8.)
But, according to Bernardine a Bustis, this mother of mercy is constantly going about in
search of sinners to save them. **_"She continually goes about seeking whom she may save."_**
(Maril. par. 3, ser. iii.) This queen of clemency, says Richard of St. Victor, presents our
petitions, and begins to assist us before we ask the assistance of her prayers;” **_Velocius
occurrit ejus pietas quam invocetur, et causas miserorum anticipat."_** (In Can., c. xxiii.)
Because, as the same author says, Mary’s heart is so full of tenderness towards us, **_that she
cannot behold our miseries without affording relief. ”Nee possis miserias scire, et non sub
venire."_**



13. Let us, then, in all our wants, be most careful to have recourse to this mother of mercy,
who is always ready to assist those who invoke her aid. ” **_Invenies semper paratam auxiliari,"_**
says Richard of St. Lawrence. She is always prepared to come to our help, and frequently
prevents our supplications: but, ordinarily, she requires that we should pray to her, and is
offended when we neglect to ask her assistance. ” **_In te domina peccant,"_** says St.
Bonaventure, ” **_non solum qui tibi injuriam irrogant, sed etiam qui te non rogant."_** (In Spec.
Virg.) Thou, blessed lady, art displeased not only with those who commit an injury against
thee, but also with those who do not ask favours from thee. Hence, as the same holy doctor
teaches, it is not possible that Mary should neglect to succour any soul that flies to her for
protection; for she cannot but pity and console the afflicted who have recourse to her. ” **_Ipsa
enim non misereri ignorat et miseris non satisfacere."_**


14. But, to obtain special favours from this good lady, we must perform in her honour certain
devotions practised by her servants; such as, first, to recite every day at least five decades of
the Rosary; secondly, to fast every Saturday in her honour. Many persons fast every Saturday
on bread and water: you should fast in this manner at least on the vigils of her seven
principal festivals. Thirdly, to say the three Aves when the bell rings for the Angelus Domini;
and to salute her frequently during the day with an Ave Maria, particularly when you hear a
clock strike, or when you see an image of the Virgin, and also when you leave or return to
your house. Fourthly, to say every evening the Litany of the Blessed Virgin before you go to
rest; and for this purpose procure an image of Mary, and keep it near your bed. Fifthly, to
wear the scapular of Mary in sorrow, and of Mount Carmel. There are many other devotions
practised by the servants of Mary; but the most useful of all is, to recommend yourself
frequently to her prayers. Never omit to say three Aves in the morning, to beg of her to
preserve you from sin during the day. In all temptations have immediate recourse to her,
saying: “Mary, assist me." To resist every temptation, it is sufficient to pronounce the names
of Jesus and Mary; and if the temptation continues, let us continue to invoke Jesus and Mary,
and the devil shall never be able to conquer us.


15. St. Bonaventure calls Mary the salvation of those who invoke her: **_"salus te invocantium."_**
And if a true servant of Mary were lost (I mean one truly devoted to her, who wishes to
amend his life, and invoke with confidence this advocate of sinners), this should happen
either because Mary would be unable or unwilling to assist him. But, says St. Bernard, this is
impossible: being the mother of omnipotence and of mercy, Mary cannot want the power or



the will to save her servants. Justly then is she called the salvation of all who invoke her aid.
Of this truth there are numberless examples: that of St. Mary of Egypt will be sufficient. After
leading for many years a sinful and dissolute life, she wished to enter the church of Jerusalem
in which the festival of the holy cross was celebrated. To make her feel her miseries, God
closed against her the door which was open to all others: as often as she endeavoured to
enter, an invisible force drove her back. She instantly perceived her miserable condition, and
remained in sorrow outside the church. Fortunately for her there was an image of most holy
Mary over the porch of the church. As a poor sinner she recommended herself to the divine
mother, and promised to change her life. After her prayer, she felt encouraged to go into the
church, and, behold! the door which was before closed against her she now finds open: she
enters, and confesses her sins. She leaves the church, and, under the influence of divine
inspiration, goes into the desert, where she lived for forty-seven years, and became a saint.


**SERMON VIII THIRD SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY. - ON THE REMORSE OF
THE DAMNED.**


**_" But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth." MATT. viii. 12._**


IN the Gospel of this day it is related that, “when Jesus Christ entered into Capharnaum,
there came to him a centurion beseeching him" to cure his servant, who lay sick of the palsy.
Jesus answered: "I will come and heal him." No," replied the centurion, ”I am not worthy that
thou shouldst enter under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant shall be healed."
(v. 8.) Seeing the centurion’s faith, the Redeemer instantly consoled him by restoring health
to his servant; and, turning to his disciples, he said: ”Many shall come from the east and the
west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of Heaven. But
the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into the exterior darkness; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth." By these words our Lord wished to signify, that many
persons born in infidelity shall be saved, and enjoy the society of the saints, and that many
who are born in the bosom of the Church shall be cast into Hell, where the worm of
conscience, by its gnawing, shall make them weep bitterly for all eternity. Let us examine the
remorses of conscience which, a damned Christian shall suffer in Hell.


First remorse, arising from the thought of the little which he required to do in order to save
his soul. Second remorse, arising from the remembrance of the trifles for which he lost his
soul. Third remorse, arising from the knowledge of the great good which he has lost through
his own fault.


**_First remorse of the damned Christian, arising from the thought of the little which he
required to do in order to save his soul._**
1. A damned soul once appeared to St. Hubert, and said, that two remorse’s were her most
cruel executioners in Hell: the thought of the little which was necessary for her to have done
in this life to secure her salvation; and the thought of the trifles for which she brought herself
to eternal misery. The same thing has been said by St. Thomas. Speaking of the reprobate, he
says: **_“They shall be in sorrow principally because they are damned for nothing, and because
they could most easily have obtained eternal life."_** Let us stop to consider this first source of
remorse; that is, how few and transitory are the pleasures for which all the damned are lost.



Each of the reprobate will say for eternity: If I abstained from such a gratification; if in certain
circumstances I overcame human respect; if I avoided such an occasion of sin such a
companion, I should not now he damned; if I had frequented some pious sodality; if I had
gone to confession every week; if in temptations I had recommended myself to God, I would
not have relapsed into sin. I have so often proposed to do these things, but I have not done
them. I began to practise these means of salvation, but afterwards gave them up; and thus I
am lost.



2. This torment of the damned will be increased by the remembrance of the good example
given them by some young companions who led a chaste and pious life even in the midst of
the world. It will be still more increased by the recollection of all the gifts which the Lord had
bestowed upon them, that by their co-operation they might acquire eternal salvation; the gifts
of nature health, riches, respectability of family, talents; all gifts granted by God, not to be
employed in the indulgence of pleasures and in the gratification of vanity, but in the
sanctification of their souls, and in becoming saints. So many gifts of grace, so many divine
lights, holy inspirations, loving calls, and so many years of life to repair past disorders. But
they shall for ever hear from the angel of the Lord that for them the time of salvation is past.
**_“The angel whom I saw standing, swore by Him that liveth for ever and ever.... that time
shall be no longer."_** (Apoc. x. 6.)


3. Alas! what cruel swords shall all these blessings received from God be to the heart of a
poor damned Christian, when he shall see himself shut up in the prison of Hell, and that
there is no more time to repair his eternal ruin! In despair he will say to his wretched
companions: **_“The harvest is past; the summer is ended; and we are not saved."_** (Jer. viii. 20.)
The time, he will say, of gathering fruits of eternal life is past; the summer, during which we
could have saved our souls, is over, but we are not saved: the winter is come; but it is an
eternal winter, in which we must live in misery and despair as long as God shall be God.


4. O fool, he will say, that I have been! If I had suffered for God the pains to which I have
submitted for the indulgence of my passions if the labours which I have endured for my own
damnation, had been borne for my salvation, how happy should I now be! And what now
remains of all past pleasures, but remorse and pain, which now torture, and shall torture me
for eternity? Finally, he will say, I might be for ever happy and now .[ must be for ever
miserable. Ah! this thought will torture the damned more than the fire and all the other
torments of Hell.


**_Second remorse of the damned, arising from the remembrance of the trifles for which they
lost their souls._**


5 Saul forbid the people, under pain of death, to taste food. His son Jonathan, who was then
young being hungry, tasted a little honey. Having discovered that Jonathan had violated the
command, the king declared that he should die. Seeing himself condemned to death,
Jonathan said with tears: **_”I did but taste a little honey, and behold I must die." (_** 1 Kings xiv.
43.) But the people, moved to pity for Jonathan, interposed with his father, and delivered him
from death. For the unhappy damned there is no compassion; there is no one to intercede
with God to deliver them from the eternal death of Hell. On the contrary, all rejoice at the just



punishment which they suffer for having wilfully lost God and Paradise for the sake of a
transitory pleasure.



6. After having eaten the pottage of lentiles for which he sold his right of primogeniture, Esau
was tortured with grief and remorse for what he had lost, and **_"roared out with a great cry."_**
(Gen. xxvii. 34.) Oh! how great shall be the roaring and howling of the damned, at the
thought of having lost, for a few poisonous and momentary pleasures, the everlasting
kingdom of Paradise, and of being condemned for eternity to a continual death!


7. The unfortunate reprobate shall be continually employed in reflecting on the unhappy
cause of their damnation. To us who live on earth our past life appears but a moment ~ but a
dream. Alas! what will the fifty or sixty years which they may have spent in this world
appear to the damned, when they shall find themselves in the abyss of eternity, and when
they shall have passed a hundred and a thousand millions of years in torments, and shall see
that their miserable eternity is only beginning, and shall be for ever in its commencement?
But have the fifty years spent on this earth been full of pleasures? Perhaps the sinner, living
in enmity with God, enjoyed uninterrupted happiness in his sins? How long do the pleasures
of sin last? Only for a few minutes; the remaining part of the lives of those who live at a distance from God is full of anguish and pain. Oh! what will these moments of pleasure
appear to a damned soul, when she shall find herself in a pit of fire?


8. ” **_What hath pride profited us? or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought us?
All those things have passed away like a shadow."_** (Wis. v. 8.) **_Unhappy me! each of the
damned shall say, I have lived on earth according to my corrupt inclinations; I have indulged
my pleasures; but what have they profited me? They have lasted but for a short time; they
have made me lead a life of bitterness and disquietude; and now I must burn in this furnace
for ever, in despair, and abandoned by all._**


**_Third remorse of the damned, arising from the knowledge of the great good which they have
lost by their own fault._**


9. A certain queen, blinded by the ambition of being a sovereign, said one day: ” **_If the Lord
gives me a reign of forty years, I shall renounce Paradise."_** The unhappy queen reigned for
forty years; but now that she is in another world, she cannot but be grieved at having made
such a renunciation. Oh! how great must be her anguish at the thought of having lost the
kingdom of Paradise for the sake of a reign of forty years, full of troubles, of crosses, and of
fears! ” **_Plus cœlo torquetor, quam gehenna,"_** says St. Peter Chrysologus. **_To the damned the
voluntary loss of Paradise is a greater loss than the very pains of Hell._**


10. The greatest pain in Hell is the loss of God, that sovereign good, who is the source of all
the joys of Paradise. ”Let torments," says St. Bruno, ”be added to torments, and let them not
be deprived of God." (Serm, de Jud. fin.) The damned would be content to have a thousand
Hells added to the Hell which they suffer provided they were not deprived of God; but their
Hell shall consist in seeing themselves deprived for ever of God through their own fault. St.
Teresa used to say, that when a person loses, through his own fault, a trifle a small sum of
money, or a ring of little value the thought of having lost it through his own neglect afflicts
him and disturbs his peace. What then must be the anguish of the damned in reflecting that
they have lost God, a good of infinite value, and have lost him through their own fault?



### 


11. The damned shall see that God wished them to be saved, and had given them the choice
of eternal life or of eternal death. **_"Before man is life and death, that which he shall choose
shall be given to him."_** (Eccles." xv. 18.) They shall see that, if they wished, they might have
acquired eternal happiness, and that, by their own choice, they are damned. On the day of
judgment they shall see many of their companions among the elect; but, because they would
not put a stop to their career of sin, they have gone to end it in Hell. “ **_Therefore we have
erred,"_** they shall say to their unhappy associates in Hell; we have erred in losing Heaven and
God through our own fault, and our error is irreparable. They shall continually exclaim:
**_“There is no peace for my bones because of my sins."_** (Ps. xxxvii. 4.) The thought of having
been the cause of their own damnation produces an internal pain, which enters into the very
bones of the damned, and prevents them from ever enjoying a moments repose. Hence, each
of them shall be to himself an object of the greatest horror. Each shall suffer the pain
threatened by the Lord: **_“I will set THEE before thy face."_** (Ps. xlix. 21.)


12. If, beloved brethren, you have hitherto been so foolish as to lose God for a miserable
pleasure, do not persevere in your folly. Endeavour, now that you have it in your power, to
repair your past error. Tremble! Perhaps, if you do not now resolve to change your life, you
shall be abandoned by God, and be lost for ever. When the Devil tempts you, remember Hell,
the thought of Hell will preserve you from that land of misery. I say, remember Hell and
have recourse to Jesus Christ and to most holy Mary, and they will deliver you from sin,
which is the gate of Hell.


**SERMON IX. FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY. - DANGERS TO ETERNAL
SALVATION.**
**_“And when he entered into the boat, his disciples followed him; and, behold, a great tempest
arose in the sea." MATT. viii. 23, 24._**


**_On the greatness of the dangers to which our eternal salvation is exposed, and on the manner
in which we ought to guard against them._**


1. IN this days Gospel we find that, when Jesus Christ entered the boat along with his
disciples, a great tempest arose, so that the boat was agitated by the waves, and was on the
point of being lost. During this storm the Saviour was asleep; but the disciples, terrified by
the storm, ran to awake him, and said: ” **_Lord, save us: we perish."_** (v. 25.) Jesus gave them
courage by saying: **_“Why are ye fearful, ye of little faith? Then rising up, he commanded the
winds and the sea, and there came a great calm."_** Let us examine what is meant by the boat in
the midst of the sea, and by the tempest which agitated the sea.


2. The boat on the sea represents man in this world. As a vessel on the sea is exposed to a
thousand dangers to pirates, to quicksands, to hidden rocks, and to tempests; so man in this
life is encompassed with perils arising from the temptations of Hell from the occasions of sin,
from the scandals or bad counsels of men, from human respect, and, above all, from the bad
passions of corrupt nature, represented by the winds that agitate the sea and expose the
vessel to great danger of being lost.


6. Thus, as St. Leo says, our life is full of dangers, of snares, and of enemies: **_“Plena omnia
periculis, plena laqueis: incitant cupiditates, insidiantur illecebræ; blandiuntur lucra."_** (S.



Leo, serm. v, de Quad.) The first enemy of the salvation of every Christian is his own
corruption. **_"But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and
allured."_** (St. James i. 14.) Along with the corrupt inclinations which live within us, and drag
us to evil, we have many enemies from without that fight against us. We have the devils,
with whom the contest is very difficult, because they are **_“stronger than we are." ”Bellum
grave, ”_** says Cassiodorus, ” **_qui cum fortiore."_** (In Psal. v.) Hence, because we have to contend
with powerful enemies, St. Paul exhorts us to arm ourselves with the divine aid: ” **_Put you on
the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the Devil. For our
wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the
rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in high places."_** (Eph.
vi. 11, 12.) The Devil, according to St. Peter, is a lion who is continually going about roaring,
through the rage and hunger which impel him to devour our souls. ” **_Your adversary, the
Devil, like a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour."_** (1 Peter, v. 8,) St.
Cyprian says that Satan is continually lying in wait for us, in order to make us his slaves:
” **_Circuit demon nos singulos, et tanquam hostis clauses obsidens muros explorat et tenat
num sit pars aliqua minis stabilis, cujus auditu ad interiora penetretur."_** (S. Cyp. lib. de zelo,
etc.)



4. Even the men with whom we must converse endanger our salvation. They persecute or
betray us, or deceive us by their flattery and bad counsels. St. Augustine says that, among the
faithful **_there are in every profession hollow and deceitful men_**. **_"Omnis professio in ecclesia
habet fictos."_** (In Ps. xciv.) Now if a fortress were full of rebels within, and encompassed by
enemies from without, who is there that would not regard it as lost? Such is the condition of
each of us as long as we live in this world. Who shall be able to deliver us from so many
powerful enemies? Only God: **_“Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that
keepeth it."_** (Ps. cxxvi. 2.)


5. What then is the means by which we can save our souls in the midst of so many dangers? It
is to imitate the holy disciples to have recourse to our Divine Master, and say to him: ” **_Save
us; we perish."_** Save us, Lord; if thou do not we are lost. When the tempest is violent, the pilot
never takes his eyes from the light which guides him to the port. In like manner we should
keep our eyes always turned to God, who alone can deliver us from the many dangers to
which we are exposed. It was thus David acted when he found himself assailed by the
dangers of sin. ” **_I have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from whence help shall come to
me."_** (Ps. cxx. 1.) To teach us to recommend ourselves continually to him who alone can save
us by his grace, the Lord has ordained that, as long as we remain on this earth, we should
live in the midst of a continual tempest, and should be surrounded by enemies. The
temptations of the Devil, the persecutions of men, the adversity which we suffer in this
world, are not evils: they are, on the contrary, advantages, if we know how to make of them
the use which God wishes, who sends or permits them for our welfare. They detach our
affections from this earth, and inspire a disgust for this world, by making us feel bitterness
and thorns even in its honours, its riches, its delights, and amusements. The Lord permits all
these apparent evils, that we may take away our affections from fading goods, in which we
meet with so many dangers of perdition, and that we may seek to unite ourselves with him
who alone can make us happy.





6. Our error and mistake is, that when we find ourselves harassed by infirmities, by poverty,
by persecutions, and by such tribulations, instead of having recourse to the Lord, we turn to
men, and place our confidence in their assistance, and thus draw upon ourselves the
malediction of God, who says, ” **_Cursed be the man who trusteth in man."_** (Jer. xvii. 5.) The
Lord does not forbid us, in our afflictions and dangers, to have recourse to human means; but
he curses those who place their whole trust in them. He wishes us to have recourse to himself
before all others, and to place our only hope in him, that we may also centre in him all our
love.


7. As long as we live on this earth, we must, according to St. Paul, **_work out our salvation
with fear and trembling_** , in the midst of the dangers by which we are beset. **_"Cum metu et
tremore vestram salutem opera mini."_** (Phil. ii. 12.) Whilst a certain vessel was in the open
sea a great tempest arose, which made the captain tremble. In the hold of the vessel there
was an animal eating with as much tranquillity as if the sea were perfectly calm. The captain
being asked why he was so much afraid, replied: If I had a soul like the soul of this brute, I
too would be tranquil and without fear; but because I have a rational and an immortal soul, I
am afraid of death, after which I must appear before the judgment-seat of God; and therefore
I tremble through fear. Let us also tremble, beloved brethren. The salvation of our immortal
souls is at stake. They who do not tremble are, as St. Paul says, in great danger of being lost;
because they who fear not, seldom recommend themselves to God, and labour but little to
adopt the means of salvation. Let us beware: we are, says St. Cyprian, **_still in battle array,
and still combat for eternal salvation. "Adhuc in acie constituti de vita nostra imicamus."_**
(S. Cypr., lib. 1, cap. i.)


8. The first means of salvation, then, is to recommend ourselves continually to God, that he
may keep his hands over us, and preserve us from offending him. The next is, to cleanse the
soul from all past sins by making a general confession. A general confession is a powerful
help to a change of life. When the tempest is violent the burden of the vessel is diminished,
and each person on board throws his goods into the sea in order to save his life. folly of
sinners, who, in the midst of such great dangers of eternal perdition, instead of diminishing
the burden of the vessel that is, instead of unburdening the soul of her sins load her with a
greater weight. Instead of flying from the dangers of sin, they fearlessly continue to put
themselves voluntarily into dangerous occasions; and, instead of having recourse to God’s
mercy for the pardon of their offences, they offend him still more, and compel him to
abandon, them.


9. Another means is, to labour strenuously not to allow ourselves to become the slaves of
irregular passions. ” **_Give me not over to a shameless and foolish mind."_** (Eccl. xxiii. 6.) Do
not, Lord, deliver me up to a mind blinded by passion. He who is blind sees not what he is
doing, and therefore he is in danger of falling into every crime. Thus so many are lost by
submitting to the tyranny of their passions. Some are slaves to the passion of avarice. A
person who is now in the other world said: Alas! I perceive that a desire of riches is
beginning to rule over me. So said the unhappy man; but he applied no remedy. He did not
resist the passion in the beginning, but fomented it till death, and thus at his last moments
left but little reason to hope for his salvation. Others are slaves to sensual pleasures. They are
not content with lawful gratifications, and therefore they pass to the indulgence of those that



are forbidden. Others are subject to anger; and because they are not careful to check the fire
at its commencement, when it is small, it increases and grows into a spirit of revenge.


10. ” **_Hi hostes cavendi,"_** says St. Ambrose, ” **_hi graviores tyranni. Multi in persecutione
publica coronati, in hac persecutione ceciderunt."_** (In Ps. cxviii. serm. 20.) Disorderly
affections, if they are not beaten down in the beginning, become our greatest tyrants. Many,
says St. Ambrose, after having victoriously resisted the persecutions of the enemies of the
faith, were afterwards lost because they did not resist the first assaults of some earthly
passion. Of this, Origen was a miserable example. He fought for, and was prepared to give
his life in defence of the faith; but, by afterwards yielding to human respect, he was led to
deny it. (Natalis Alexander, His. Eccl., tom. 7, dis. xv., q. 2, a. 1.) We have still a more
miserable example in Solomon, who, after having received so many gifts from God, and after
being inspired by the Holy Ghost, was, by indulging a passion for certain pagan, women,
induced to offer incense to idols. The unhappy man who submits to the slavery of his wicked
passions, resembles the ox that is sent to the slaughter after a life of constant labour. During
their whole lives worldlings groan under the weight of their sins, and, at the end of their
days, fall into Hell.



11. Let us conclude. When the winds are strong and violent, the pilot lowers the sails and
casts anchor. So, when we find ourselves assailed by any bad passion, we .should always
lower the sails; that is, we should avoid all the occasions which may increase the passion and
should cast anchor by uniting ourselves to God, and by begging of him to give us strength
not to offend him.


12. But some of you will say, What am I to do? I live in the midst of the world, where my
passions continually assail me even against my will. I will answer in the words of Origen:
**_“Donee quis in tenebris sæculanbus manet et in negotiorum obscuritate versatur, non potest
servire Domino. Exeundum est ergo de Egypto, relmquendus est mundus, non loco sed
ammo."_** (Hom. 111. in Exod.) The man who lives in the darkness of the world and in the
midst of secular business, can with difficulty serve God. Whoever then wishes to insure his
eternal salvation, let him retire from the world, and take refuge in one of those exact religious
communities which are the secure harbours in the sea of this world. If he cannot actually
leave the world, let him leave it at least in affection, by detaching his heart from the things of
this world, and from his own evil inclinations: **_"Go not after thy lusts,"_** says the Holy Ghost,
**_"but turn away from thy own will."_** (Eccl. xviii. 30.) Follow not your own concupiscence; and
when your will impels you to evil, you must not indulge, but must resist its inclinations.


13. **_"The time is short: it remaineth that they also who have wives be as if they had none; and
they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as it they rejoiced not; and
they that buy, as if they possessed not; and they that use this world, as if they used it not; for
the fashion of this world passeth away”_** (1 Cor. vii. 29, etc.) The time of life is short; we
should then prepare for death, which is rapidly approaching; and to prepare for that awful
moment, let us reflect that everything in this world shall soon end. Hence, the Apostle tells
those who suffer in this life to be as if they suffered not, because the miseries of this life shall
soon pass away, and they who save their souls shall be happy for eternity; and he exhorts
those who enjoy the goods of this earth to be as if they enjoyed them not, because they must
one day leave all things; and if they lose their souls, they shall be miserable for ever.

### SERMON X. FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY. - ON THE PAINS OF HELL.


**_" Gather up first the cockle, and bind into bundles to burn." MATT. xiii. 30._**


**_I shall first speak of the fire, which is the principal pain that torments the senses of the
damned, and afterwards of the other pains of hell._**



1. BEHOLD! the final doom of sinners who abuse the divine mercy is, to burn in the fire of
hell. **_God threatens hell, not to send us there, but to deliver us from that place of torments.
”Minatur Deus gehennem, ”_** says St. Chrysostom, ” **_ut a gehenna liberet, et ut firmi ac stabiles
evitemus minas."_** (Hom. v. de Pœnit.) Remember, then, brethren, that God gives you Today
the opportunity of hearing this sermon, that you may be preserved from hell, and that you
may give up sin, which alone can lead you to hell.


2. My brethren, it is certain and of faith that there is a hell. After judgment the just shall enjoy
the eternal glory of Paradise, and sinners shall be condemned to suffer the everlasting
chastisement reserved for them in hell. **_"And these shall go into everlasting punishment, but
the just into life everlasting."_** (Matt. xxv. 46.) Let us examine in what hell consists. It is what
the rich glutton called it **_a place of torments_**. **_“In hunc locum tormentorum."_** (Luc. xvi. 28.) It
is a place of suffering, where each of the senses and powers of the damned has its proper
torment, and in which the torments of each person will be increased in proportion to the
forbidden pleasures in which he indulged. **_“As much as she hath glorified herself and lived in
delicacies, so much torment and sorrow give ye to her."_** (Apoc. xviii. 7.)


3. In offending God the sinner does two evils: he abandons God, the sovereign good, who is
able to make him happy, and turns to creatures, who are incapable of giving any real
happiness to the soul. Of this injury which men commit against him, the Lord complains by
his prophet Jeremiah: **_"For my people have done two evils. They have forsaken me, the
fountain of living waters, and have digged to themselves cisterns broken cisterns that can
hold no water."_** (Jer. ii. 13.) Since, then, the sinner turns his back on God, he shall be
tormented in hell, by the pain arising from the loss of God, of which I shall speak on another
occasion [see the Sermon for the nineteenth Sunday after Pentecost], and since, in offending
God, he turns to creatures, he shall be justly tormented by the same creatures, and principally
by fire.


4. ” **_The vengeance on the flesh of the ungodly is fire and worms."_** (Eccl vii. 19.) Fire and the
remorse of conscience are the principal means by which God takes vengeance on the flesh of
the wicked. Hence, in condemning the reprobate to hell, Jesus Christ commands them to go
into eternal fire. : ” **_Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire."_** (Matt. xxv. 41.) This
fire, then, shall be one of the most cruel executioners of the damned.


5. Even in this life the pain of fire is the most terrible of all torments. But St. Augustine says,
that **_in comparison of the fire of hell, the fire of this earth is no more than a picture compared
with the reality, “In cuius comparatione noster hie ignus depictus est. ”_** Anselm teaches, that
the fire of hell as far surpasses the fire of this world, **_as the fire of the real exceeds that of
painted fire._** The pain, then, produced by the fire of hell is far greater than that which is
produced by our fire because God has made the fire of this earth for the use of man, but he
has created the fire of hell purposely for the chastisement of sinners; and therefore, as



Tertullian says, he has made it a minister of his justice. ” **_Longe alius est ignis, qui usui
humano, alms qui Dei justitiæ deservit."_** This avenging fire is always kept alive by the wrath
of God. ” **_A fire is kindled in my rage_**. ” (Jer. xv 14)


6 **_"And the rich man also died, and he was buried in hell."_** (Luke xvi. 22.) The damned are
buried in the fire of hell; hence they have an abyss of fire below, an abyss of fire above, and
an abyss of fire on every side. As a fish in the sea is surrounded by water, so the unhappy
reprobate are encompassed by fire on every side. The sharpness of the pain of fire may be
inferred from the circumstance, that the rich glutton complained of no other torment. ”I am
tormented in this flame." (Ibid, v 23.)


7 The Prophet Isaias says that the Lord will punish the guilt of sinners with the spirit of fire.
**_“If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion by the spirit of burning"_** (iv.
4). ” **_The spirit of burning"_** is the pure essence of fire. All spirits or essences, though taken
from simple herbs or flowers, are so penetrating, that they reach the very bones. Such is the
fire of hell. Its activity is so great, that a single spark of it would be sufficient to melt a
mountain of bronze. **_The disciple_** relates, that a damned person, who appeared to a religious,
dipped his hand into a vessel of water; the religious placed in the vessel a candlestick of
bronze, which was instantly dissolved.



8. This fire shall torment the damned not only externally, but also internally. It will burn the
bowels, the heart, the brains, the blood within the veins, and the marrow within the bones.
The skin of the damned shall be like a caldron, in which their bowels, their flesh, and their
bones shall be burned. David says, that the bodies of the damned shall be like so many
furnaces of fire. ” **_Thou shalt make them as an oven of fire in the time of thy anger."_** (Ps. xx.
10.)


9. O God! certain sinners cannot bear to walk under a strong sun, or to remain before a large
fire in a close room; they cannot endure a spark from a candle; and they fear not the fire of
hell, which, according to the Prophet Isaias, not only burns, but devours the unhappy
damned. ” **_Which of you can dwell with devouring fire. ”_** (Isaias xxxiii. 14.) As a lion devours a
lamb, so the fire of hell devours the reprobate; but it devours without destroying life, and
thus tortures them with a continual death. **_Continue,_** says St. Peter Damian **_to the sinner who
indulges in impurity, continue to satisfy your flesh; a day will come, or rather an eternal
night, when your impurities, like pitch, shall nourish a fire within your very bowels. "Venit
dies, imo nox, quando libido tua vertetur in picem qua se nutriet perpetuus ignis in visceribus
tuis."_** (Epist. 6.) And according to St. Cyprian, the impurities of the wicked shall boil in the
very fat which will issue from their accursed bodies.


10, St. Jerome teaches, that in this fire sinners **_shall suffer not only the pain of the fire, but
also all the pains which men endure on this earth. “In uno igne omnia supplicia sentient in
inferno peccatores."_** (Ep. ad Pam.) How manifold are the pains to which men are subject in
this life. Pains in the sides, pains in the head, pains in the loins, pains in the bowels. All these
together torture the damned.


11. The fire itself will bring with it the pain of darkness; for, by its smoke it will, according to
St. John, produce a storm of darkness which shall blind the damned. ” **_To whom the storm of_**



**_darkness is reserved for ever."_** (St. Jude 13.) Hence, hell is called a land of darkness covered
with the shadow of death. ” **_A land that is dark and covered with the mist of death a land of
misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and no order but everlasting horror
dwelleth."_** (Job x. 21, 22.) To hear that a criminal is shut up in a dungeon for ten or twenty
years excites our compassion. Hell is a dungeon closed on every side, into which a ray of the
sun or the light of a candle never enters. Thus the damned” **_shall never see light." (_** Ps xlviii.
20.) The fire of this world gives light, but the fire of hell is utter darkness. In explaining the
words of David, ” **_the voice of the Lord divideth the flame of fire,"_** (Ps. xxviii. 7,) St. Basil says,
that in hell the Lord separates the fire that burns from the flame which illuminates, and
therefore this fire burns, but gives no light. B. Albertus Magnus explains this passage more
concisely by saying that God” **_divides the heat from the light."_** St. Thomas teaches, that **_in hell
there is only so much light as is necessary to torment the damned by the sight of their
associates and of the devils_** : **_“Quantum sufficit ad videndum ilia quæ torquere possunt."_** (3
p., q. 97, art. 5.) And according to St. Augustine, **_the bare sight of these infernal monsters
excites sufficient terror to cause the death of all the damned, if they were capable of dying.
“Videbunt monstra, quorum visio postet illos occidere."_**



12. To suffer a parching thirst, without having a drop of water to quench it, is intolerably
painful. It has sometimes happened, that travellers who could procure no refreshment after a
long journey, have fainted from the pain produced by thirst. So great is the thirst of the
damned, that if one of them were offered all the water on this earth, he would exclaim: All
this water is not sufficient to extinguish the burning thirst which I endure. But, alas! the
unhappy damned shall never have a single drop of water to refresh their tongues. **_“He cried
out and said: Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip
of his finger in water, to cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame. ”_** (St. Luke xvi. 24.)
The rich glutton has not obtained, and shall never obtain, this drop of water, as long as God
shall be God.


13. The reprobate shall be likewise tormented by the stench which pervades hell. The stench
shall arise from the very bodies of the damned. **_“Out of their carcasses shall arise a stink."_**
(Isaiah xxxiv. 3.) The bodies of the damned are called carcasses, not because they are dead
(for they are living, and shall be forever alive to pain), but on account of the stench which
they exhale. Would it not be very painful to be shut up in a close room with a fetid corpse? St.
Bonaventure says, **_that if the body of one of the damned were placed in the earth, it would,
by its stench, be sufficient to cause the death of all men._** How intolerable, then, must it be to
live for ever in the dungeons of hell in the midst of the immense multitudes of the damned!
Some foolish worldlings say: **_If I go to hell, I shall not be there alone._** Miserable fools! do you
not see that the greater the number of your companions, the more insufferable shall be your
torments? **_“There,"_** says St. Thomas, ” **_the society of the reprobate shall cause an increase and
not a diminution of misery."_** (Suppl., q. 86, art. 1.) The society of the reprobate augments
their misery, because each of the damned is a source of suffering to all the others. Hence, the
greater their number, the more they shall mutually torment each other. ” **_And the people,"_**
says the prophet Isaias, “ **_shall be ashes after a fire, as a bundle of thorns they shall be burnt
with fire."_** (Isa. xxxiii. 12.) Placed in the midst of the furnace of hell, the damned are like so
many grains reduced to ashes by that abyss of fire, and like so many thorns tied together and
wounding each other.





14. They are tormented not only by the stench of their companions, but also by their shrieks
and lamentations. How painful it is to a person longing for sleep to hear the groans of a sick
man, the barking of a dog, or the screams of an infant. The damned must listen incessantly to
the wailing and howling of their associates, not for a night, nor for a thousand nights, but for
all eternity, without the interruption of a single moment.


15. The damned are also tormented by the narrowness of the place in which they are
confined; for, although the dungeon of hell is large, it will be too small for so many millions
of the reprobate, who like sheep shall be heaped one over the other. **_“They are,"_** says David,
**_"laid in hell like sheep."_** (Ps. xlviii. 15.) We learn from the Scriptures that they shall be
pressed together like grapes in the winepress, by the vengeance of an angry God. ” **_The
winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of God the Almighty."_** (Apoc. xix. 15.) From this
pressure shall arise the pain of immobility. “ **_Let them become unmoveable as a stone."_** (Exod.
xvi. 16.) In whatever position the damned shall fall into hell after the general judgment,
whether on the side, or on the back, or with the head downwards, in that they must remain
for eternity, without being ever able to move foot or hand or finger, as long as God shall be
God. In a word, St. Chrysostom says, that all the pains of this life, however great they may
be, are scarcely a shadow of the torments of the damned. ” **_Hæc omnia ludicra sunt et risus ad
ilia supplicia: pone ignem, ferrum, et bestias, attamen vix umbra sunt ad ilia tormenta."_**
(Hom, xxxix. ad pop. Ant.)


16. The reprobate, then, shall be tormented in all the senses of the body. They shall also be
tormented in all the powers of the soul. Their memory shall be tormented by the
remembrance of the years which they had received from God for the salvation of their souls,
and which they spent in labouring for their own damnation; by the remembrance of so many
graces and so many divine lights which they abused. Their understanding shall be tormented
by the knowledge of the great happiness which they forfeited in losing their souls, heaven,
and God; and by a conviction that this loss is irreparable. Their will shall be tormented by
seeing that whatsoever they ask or desire shall be refused. **_"The desire of the wicked shall
perish."_** (Ps. cxi. 10.) They shall never have any of those things for which they wish, and must
for ever suffer all that is repugnant to their will. They would wish to escape from these
torments and to find peace; but in these torments they must for ever remain, and peace they
shall never enjoy.


17. Perhaps they may sometimes receive a little comfort, or at least enjoy occasional repose?
No, says Cyprian: ” **_Nullum ibi refrigerium, nullum remedium, atque ita omni tormento
atrocius desperatio."_** (Serm. de Ascens.) In this life, how great soever may be the tribulations
which we suffer, there is always some relief or interruption. The damned must remain for
ever in a pit of fire, always in torture, always weeping, without ever enjoying a moments
repose. But perhaps there is some one to pity their sufferings? At the very time that they are
so much afflicted the devils continually reproach them with the sins for which they are
tormented, saying: Suffer, burn, live for ever in despair: you yourselves have been the cause
of your destruction. And do not the saints, the divine mother, and God, who is called the
Father of Mercies, take compassion on their miseries? No;” **_the sun shall be darkened, and the
moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven."_** (Matt. xxvi. 29.) The
saints, represented by the stars, not only do not pity the damned, but they even rejoice in the
vengeance inflicted on the injuries offered to their God. Neither can the divine mother pity



them, because they hate her Son. And Jesus Christ, who died for the love of them, cannot pity
them, because they have despised his love, and have voluntarily brought themselves to
perdition.


**SERMON XI. SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER THE EPIPHANY. - ON THE DEATH OF THE
JUST.**
**_"The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures
of meal until the whole was leavened." MATT. xiii. 33._**


IN this days gospel we find that a woman, after putting leaven in the dough, waits till the
entire is fermented. Here the Lord gives us to understand that the kingdom of heaven that is,
the attainment of eternal beatitude is like the leaven. By the leaven is understood the divine
grace, which makes the soul acquire merits for eternal life. But this eternal life is obtained
only when”the whole is leavened ;" that is, when the soul has arrived at the end of the
present life and the completion of her merits. We shall, then, speak Today of the death of the
just, which we should not fear, but should desire with our whole souls. For, says St.
Bonaventure, **_“Triplex in morte congratulatio, hominem ab omni labore, peccato, et periculo
liberari."_** Man should rejoice at death, for three reasons **_First, because death delivers him
from labour that is, from suffering the miseries of this life and the assault of his enemies.
Secondly, because it delivers him from actual sins. Thirdly, because it delivers him from the
danger of falling into hell, and opens Paradise to him._**


**_First Point. Death delivers us from the miseries of this life, and from the assaults of our
enemies._**



1. What is death? St. Eucherius answers, that **_“death is the end of miseries."_** Job said that our
life, however short it may be, is full of miseries, of infirmities, of crosses, of persecutions, and
fears. **_“Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries."_** (Job xiv.
1.) What, says St. Augustine, **_do men who wish for a prolongation of life on this earth desire
but a prolongation of suffering ?" “Quid est diu vivere nisi diu tor queri."_** (Serm. xviL de
Serb. Dom.) Yes; for, as St. Ambrose remarks, **_the present life was given to us not for repose
or enjoyment, but for labour and suffering, that by toils and pains we may merit Paradise.
”Hæc vita homini non ad quitem data est, sed ad laborem."_** (Serm. xliii.) Hence the same
holy doctor says, that, though death is the punishment of sin, still the miseries of this life are
so great, that death appears to be a relief rather than a chastisement: ” **_Ut mors remediuni
videatur esse, non pœna. ”_**


2. To those who love God, the severest of all the crosses of this life are the assaults of hell to
rob them of the divine grace. Hence St. Denis the Areopagite says, that they joyfully meet
death, as the end of their combats, and embrace it with gladness, because they hope to die a
good death, and to be thus freed from all fear of ever again falling into sin. ” **_Divino gaudio et
mortis terminum tanquam ad finem certaminum tendunt, non amplius metuentus pervertii."_**
(De Hier. Eccl., cap. vii.) The greatest consolation which a soul that loves God experiences at
the approach of death, arises from the thought of being delivered from so many temptations,
from so many remorses of conscience, and from so many dangers of offending God. Ah! says
St. Ambrose, as long as we live, **_"we walk among snares."_** We walk continually in the midst
of the snares of our enemies, who lie in wait to deprive us of the life of grace. It was the fear
of falling into sin that made St. Peter of Alcantara, in his last moments, say to a lay brother



who, in attending the saint, accidently touched him: ” **_Brother, remove, remove from me, for I
am still alive and in danger of being lost."_** The thought of being freed from the danger of sin
by death consoled St. Teresa, and made her rejoice as often as she heard the clock strike, that
an hour of the combat was past. Hence she used to say: ” **_In each moment of life we may sin
and lose God."_** Hence the news of approaching death filled the saints not with sorrow or
regret, but with sentiments of joy; because they knew that their struggles and the dangers of
losing the divine grace were soon to have an end.


3. ” **_But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest."_** (Wis. iv. 7.) He who is
prepared to die, regards death as a relief. If, says St. Cyprian, you lived in a house whose roof
and walls were tottering and threatening destruction, would you not fly from, it as soon as
possible? In this life everything menaces ruin to the poor soul the world, the devils, the flesh,
the passions, all draw her to sin and to eternal death. It was this that made St. Paul exclaim:
” **_Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?"_** (Rom. vii. 24.) Who shall deliver me
from this body of mine, which lives continually in a dying state, on account of the assaults of
my enemies? Hence he esteemed death as a great gain, because it brought to him the
possession of Jesus Christ, his true life. Happy then are they who die in the Lord: because
they escape from pains and toils, and go to rest. ” **_Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.
From henceforth now, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours."_** (Apoc. xiv. 13.)
It is related in the lives of the ancient fathers, that one of them who was very old, when
dying, smiled, while the others wept. Being asked why he smiled, he said: **_“Why do you weep
at seeing me go to rest? Ex labore ad requiem vado, et vos ploratis ?"_** At the hour of death, St.
Catherine of Sienna said to her sisters in religion: Rejoice with me: for I leave this land of
suffering, and am going to the kingdom of peace. The death of the saints is called a sleep that
is, the repose which God gives to his servants as the reward of their toil” **_When he shall give
sleep to his beloved, behold the inheritance of the Lord."_** (Ps. cxxvi. 2.) Hence the soul that
loves God neither weeps nor is troubled at the approach of death, but, embracing the crucifix,
and burning with love, she says: ” **_In peace in the self same I will sleep and I will rest."_** (Ps.
iv. 9.)



4. That **_"Proficiscere de hoc mundo," (" Depart, Christian soul, from this world,")_** which is so
appalling to sinners at the hour of death, does not alarm the saints. ” **_But the souls of the just
are in the hands of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them."_** (Wis. iii. 1.) The
saint is not afflicted, like worldlings, at the thought of being obliged to leave the goods of this
earth, because he has kept the soul detached from them. During life, he always regarded God
as the Lord of his heart and as the sole riches which he desired: ” **_What have I in heaven? and,
besides thee, what do I desire upon earth? Thou art the God of my heart and the God that is
my portion for ever."_** (Ps. Ixxxii. 25, 26.) He is not afflicted at leaving honours, because the
only honour which he sought was, to love and to be loved by God. All the honours of this
world he has justly esteemed as smoke and vanity. He is not afflicted at leaving his relatives,
because he loved them only in God. In his last moments he recommends them to his
heavenly Father, who loves them more than he does. And having a secure confidence of
salvation, he hopes to be better able to assist his relatives from Paradise, than on this earth. In
a word, what he frequently said during life, he continues to repeat with greater fervour at the
hour of death” **_My God and my all."_**





5. Besides, his peace is not disturbed by the pains of death; but, seeing that he is now at the
end of his life, and that he has no more time to suffer for God, or to offer him other proofs of
love, he accepts those pains with joy, and offers them to God as the last remains of life; and
uniting his death with the death of Jesus Christ, he offers it to the Divine Majesty.


6. And although the remembrance of the sins which he has committed will afflict, it will not
disturb him; for, since he is convinced that the Lord will forget the sins of all true penitents,
the very sorrow which he feels for his sins, gives him an assurance of pardon. ” **_If the wicked
do penance. ... I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done."_** (Ezec. xviii. 21 and
22.) **_"How,"_** asks St. Basil, **_"can anyone be certain that God has pardoned his sins? He may be
certain of pardon if he say: I have hated and abhorred iniquity."_** (In Reg. inter. 12.) He who
detests his sins, and offers to God his death in atonement for them, may rest secure that God
has pardoned them. ” **_Mors,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_quæ in lege naturæ erat poona peccati in
lege gratiæ est hostia pro peccato."_** (Lib. iv. de Trin. c. xxii.) Death, which was a chastisement
of sin under the law of nature, has become, in the law of grace, a victim of penance, by which
the pardon of sin is obtained.


7. The very love which a soul bears to God, assures her of his grace, and delivers her from the
fear of being lost. ” **_Charity casteth out fear."_** (1 John iv. 18.) If, at the hour of death, you are
unwilling to pardon an enemy, or to restore what is not your own, or if you wish to keep up
an improper friendship, then tremble for your eternal salvation; for you have great reason to
be afraid of death; but if you seek to avoid sin, and to preserve in your heart a testimony that
you love God, be assured that he is with you: and if the Lord is with you, what do you fear?
And if you wish to be assured that you have within you the divine love, embrace death with
peace, and offer it from your heart to God. He that offers to God his death, makes an act of
love the most perfect that is possible for him to perform; because, by cheerfully embracing
death to please God, at the time and in the manner which God ordains, he becomes like the
martyrs, the entire merit of whose martyrdom consisted in suffering and dying to please
God.


**_Second Point. Death frees us from actual sins._**
8. It is impossible to live in this world without committing at least some slight faults. ” **_A just
man shall fall seven times: ”_** (Prov. xxiv. 16.) He who ceases to live, ceases to offend God.
Hence St. Ambrose called death the burial of vices: by death they are buried, and never
appear again. ” **_Quid est mors nisi sepultura vitorum?"_** (De Bono Mort. cap. iv.) The
venerable Vincent Caraffa consoled himself at the hour of death by saying: now that I cease
to live, I cease for ever to offend my God. He who dies in the grace of God, goes into that
happy state in which he shall love God for ever, and shall never more offend him.
” **_Mortuus,"_** says the same holy doctor, ” **_nescit peccare. Quid tanto pere vita mistam
desideramus, in qua quanto diutius quis fuerit, tanto majori oneratur sarcina peccatorum."_**
How can we desire this life, in which the longer we live, the greater shall be the load of our
sins?


9. Hence the Lord praises the dead more than any man living: ” **_I praised the dead rather than
the living_** ." (Eccl. iv. 2.) Because no man on this earth, however holy he may be, is exempt
from sins. A spiritual soul gave directions that the person who should bring to her the news



of death, should say: ” **_Console yourself, for the time has arrived when you shall no longer
offend God."_**



10. St. Ambrose adds, that God permitted death to enter into the world, that, by dying, men
should cease to sin: **_"Passus est Dominus subintrare mortem ut culpa cessaret."_** (Loco cit.) It
is, then, a great error to imagine that death is a chastisement for those who love God. It is a
mark of the love which God bears to them , because he shortens their life to put an end to sin,
from which they cannot be exempt as long as they remain on this earth. ” **_For his soul pleased
God: therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities."_** (Wis. iv. 14.)


**_Third Point. Death delivers us from the danger of falling into hell, and opens Paradise to us._**
11. ” **_Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of the saints."_** (Ps. cxv. 16.) Considered
according to the senses, death excites fear and terror; but, viewed with the eye of faith, it is
consoling and desirable. To the saints it is as amiable and as precious, as it appears terrible to
sinners. ” **_It is precious,"_** says St. Bernard, ” **_as the end of labours, the consummation of
victory, the gate of life."_** The joy of the cup-bearer of Pharaoh, at hearing from Joseph that he
should soon be released from prison, bears no comparison to that which a soul that loves
God feels on hearing that she is to be liberated from the exile of this earth, and to be
transported to the enjoyment of God in her true country. The Apostle says, that, as long as we
remain in the body, we wander at a distance from our country in a strange land, and far
removed from the life of God: ” **_While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord."_** (2
Cor. v. 6.) Hence, St. Bruno teaches, that **_our death should not be called death, but the
beginning of life. ”Mors dicenda non est, sed vitæ principium."_** And St. Athanasius says:
” **_Non est justis mors sed translatio."_** To the just, death is but a passage from the miseries of
this earth to the eternal delights of Paradise. **_O desirable death!_** exclaimed St. Augustine; **_who
is there that does not desire thee? For thou art the term of evils, the end of toils, and the
beginning of everlasting repose!”O mors desirabilis, malorum finis, laboris clausula, quietis
principium."_**


12. No one can enter into heaven to see God without passing through the gate of death. ” **_This
is the gate of the Lord the just shall enter into it."_** (Ps. cxvii. 20.) Hence, addressing death, St.
Jerome said: ” **_Aperi mini soror mea." Death, my sister, if you do not open the gate to me, I
cannot enter to enjoy my God_**. And St. Charles Borromeo, seeing in his house a picture of
death with a knife in the hand, sent for a painter to cancel the knife, and substitute for it a key
of gold; because, said the saint, it is death that opens Paradise. Were a queen confined in a
dark prison, how great would be her joy at hearing that the gates of the prison are open, and
that she is to return from the dungeon to her palace! It was to be liberated by death from the
prison of this life that David asked, when he said: ” **_Bring my soul out of prison."_** (Ps. cxli. 8.)
This, too, was the favour which the venerable Simeon asked of the infant Jesus, when he held
him in his arms: ” **_Now thou dost dismiss thy servant_** ." (Luke ii. 29.)” **_As if detained by force,"_**
says St. Ambrose, ” **_he asked to be dismissed."_** Simeon sought to be delivered by death, as if
he had been compelled by force to live on this earth.


13. St. Cyprian says, that the sinner who shall pass from temporal to eternal death, has just
reason to be afraid of death. **_"Mori timeat, qui ad secundum mortem de hac morte transibit."_**
But he who is in the state of grace and hopes to pass from death to eternal life which is the
true life tears not death. It is related that a certain rich man gave to St. John the Almoner a



large sum of money to be dispensed in alms, for the purpose of obtaining from God a long
life for his only son. The son died in a short time. The father complained of the death of his
son; but, to console him, the Lord sent an angel to say to him: **_"You have sought a long life for
your son, and the Lord has heard your prayer; for your son is in heaven, where he enjoys
eternal life."_** This is the grace which, according to the promise of the prophet Osee, the
Redeemer obtained for us. ” **_death, I will be thy death."_** (xiii. 14.) By His redemption, Jesus
Christ destroyed death, and changed it into a source of life to us. When St. Pionius, martyr,
was asked how he could go to death with so much joy, he answered: ” **_You err; I do not go to
death but to life."“Erratis non ad mortem, sed ad vitam contendo."_** (Apud Eusub., lib. iv.
cap. xiv ) Thus also St. Symphorosa exhorted her son, St. Symphorian, to martyrdom: ” **_My
son,"_** said she, ” **_life is not taken away from you; it is only changed for a better one."_**



14. St. Augustine says, that they who love God desire to see him speedily, and that, therefore,
to them life is a cause of suffering, and death an occasion of joy. **_"Patienter vivit,
delectabiliter moritur."_** (Trac. ix. in Ep. Joan.) St. Teresa used to say, that to her life was
death. Hence she composed the celebrated hymn, ” **_I die because I do not die."_** To that great
servant of God D. Sancia Carriglio a penitent of Father M. Avila it was one day revealed, that
she had but a year to live; she answered: ” **_Alas! must I remain another year at a distance
from God? O sorrowful year, which will appear to me longer than an age."_** Such is the
language of souls who love God from their heart. It is a mark of little love of God not to
desire to see him speedily.


15. Some of you will say: I desire to go to God, but I fear death. I am afraid of the assaults
which I shall then experience from hell. I find that the saints have trembled at the hour of
death; how much more ought I to tremble! I answer: It is true that hell does not cease to assail
even the saints at death, but it is also true that God does not cease to assist his servants at that
moment; and when the dangers are increased, he multiplies his helps. ” **_Ibi plus auxilii,"_** says
St. Ambrose, ” **_ubi plus periculi."_** (ad Jos. cap. v.) The servant of Eliseus was struck with terror
when he saw the city surrounded by enemies; but the saint inspired him with courage by
showing to him a multitude of angels sent by God to defend it. Hence the prophet afterwards
said: ” **_Fear not, for there are more with us than with them."_** (4 Kings vi. 16.) The powers of
hell will assail the dying Christian; but his angel guardian will come to console him. His
patrons, and St. Michael, who has been appointed by God to defend his faithful servants in
their last combat with the devils, will come to his aid. The mother of God will come to assist
those who have been devoted to her. Jesus Christ shall come to defend from the assaults of
hell the souls for which he died on a cross: he will give them confidence and strength to resist
every attack. Hence, filled with courage, they will say: **_"The Lord is my light and my
salvation: whom shall I fear?"_** (Isa. xxvi. I.) Truly has Origen said, that the Lord is more
desirous of our salvation than the devil is of our perdition, because God’s love for us far
surpasses the devil’s hatred of our souls. ” **_Major ilia cura est, ut nos ad veram pertrahat
salutem, quam diabolo, ut nos ad æternam damnationem impellat."_** (Hom, xx.)


16. God is faithful, he will never permit us to be tempted above our strength: ” **_Fidelis Deus
non patietur vos tentari supra id quod potestis."_** (1 Cor. x. 13.) It is true that some saints have
suffered great fear at the hour of death; but they have been few. The Lord, as Belluacensis
says, has permitted this fear to cleanse them at death from some defect. ” **_Justi quandoque
dure moriendo purgantur in hoc mundo."_** But we know that, generally speaking, the saints



have died with a joyful countenance. Father Joseph Scamacca, a man of a holy life, being
asked if, in dying, he felt confidence in God, answered: Have I served Mahomet, that I should
now doubt of the goodness of my God, or of his wish to save me? Ah! the Lord knows well
how to console his servants in their last moments. Even in the midst of the agony of death, he
infuses into their souls a certain sweetness and a certain foretaste of that happiness which he
will soon bestow upon them. As they who die in sin begin to experience from the bed of
death a certain foretaste of hell certain extraordinary terrors, remorses, and fits of despair; so,
on the other hand, the saints, by the fervent acts of divine love which they then make, and by
the confidence and the desire which they feel of soon seeing God, taste, before death, that
peace which they shall afterwards fully enjoy in heaven.



17. Father Suarez died with so much peace, that in his last moments he said: ” **_I could not
have imagined that death was so sweet."_** Being advised by his physician not to fix his
thoughts so constantly on death, Cardinal Baronius said: **_Is it lest the fear of death should
shorten my life? I fear not; on the contrary, I love and desire death._** Of the Cardinal Bishop of
Rochester, Saunders relates, that, in preparing to die for the faith, he put on his best clothes,
saying that ho was going to a nuptial feast. When he came within view of the place of
execution, he threw away his staff, and said: **_O my feet, walk fast; for we are not far from
Paradise. ”Ite pedes, parum a paradiso distamus."_** Before death, he wished to recite the TE
DEUM, in thanksgiving to God for permitting him to die for the holy faith; and, full of joy, he
laid his head on the block. St. Francis of Assisium began to sing at the hour of death. **_Brother
Elias said to him: Father, at the hour of death, we ought rather to weep than to sing. But,
replied the saint, I cannot abstain from singing at the thought of soon going to enjoy God._** A
nun of the order of St. Teresa, in her last moments, said to her sisters in religion, who were in
tears: **_O God! why do you weep? I am going to possess my Jesus; if you love me, weep not,
but rejoice with me._** (Dis. Parol. i. 6.)


18. Father Granada relates, that a certain sportsman found in a wood a solitary singing in his
last agony. How, said the sportsman, can you sing in such a state? The hermit replied:
Brother, between me and God there is nothing but the wall of this body. I now see that since
my flesh is falling in pieces, the prison shall be destroyed, and I shall soon go to see God. It is
for this reason I rejoice and sing. Through the desire of seeing God, St. Ignatius, martyr, said,
that if the wild beasts should spare him, he would provoke them to devour him. **_"Ego vim
faciam, ut devorer."_** St. Catherine of Genoa was astonished that some persons regarded death
as a misfortune, and said: ” **_O beloved death, in what a mistaken light do men view you! Why
do you not come to me? 1 call on you day and night”_** (Vita, c. 7.)


19. Oh! how peculiarly happy is the death of the servants of Mary! Father Binetti relates, that
a person whom he assisted in his last moments, and who was devoted to the Blessed Virgin,
said to him: ” **_Father, you cannot conceive the consolation which arises at death from the
remembrance of having served Mary. Ah! my father, if you knew what happiness I feel on
account of having served this good mother! I cannot express it."_** What joy shall the lovers of
Jesus Christ experience at his coming to them in the most holy viaticum! Happy the soul that
can then address her Saviour in the words which St. Philip Neri used when the viaticum was
brought to him: ” **_Behold my love! behold my love! give me my love!"_** But, to entertain these
sentiments at death, we must have ardently loved Jesus Christ during life.





### SERMON XII. SEPTUAGESIMA SUNDAY. - ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SALVATION.


**_" He sent them into his vineyard." MATTHEW xx. 2_**


THE vines of the Lord are our souls, which he has given us to cultivate by good works, that
we may be one day admitted into eternal glory. **_"How,"_** says Salvian, ” **_does it happen that a
Christian believes, and still does not fear the future?"_** Christians believe death, judgment,
hell, and Paradise: but they live as if they believed them not as if these truths of faith were
tables or the inventions of human genius. Many live as it they were never to die, or as if they
had not to give God an account of their life as if there were neither hell nor a heaven. Perhaps
they do not believe in them? They believe, but do not reflect on them; and thus they are lost.
They take all possible care of worldly affairs, but attend not to the salvation of their souls. I
shall show you, this day, that the salvation of your souls is the most important of all affairs.


First Point. Because, if the soul is lost, all is lost; Second Point. Because, if the soul is lost once,
it is lost for ever.


**_First Point. If the soul is lost, all is lost._**



1. **_"But,"_** says St. Paul, **_"we entreat you .... that you do your own business."_** (1 Thess. iv. 10,
11.) The greater part of worldlings are most attentive to the business of this world. What
diligence do they not employ to gain a law-suit or a post of emolument! How many means
are adopted how many measures taken? They neither eat nor sleep. And what efforts do they
make to save their souls? All blush at being told that they neglect the affairs of their families;
and how few are ashamed to neglect the salvation of their souls. ” **_Brethren,"_** says St. Paul, **_I
entreat you that you do your own business ;"_** that is, the business of your eternal salvation.


2. **_"Nugæ puerorum,"_** says St. Bernard, ” **_nugæ vocantur, nugæ malorum negotia vocantur."_**
The trifles of children are called trifles, but the trifles of men are called business; and for
these many lose their souls. If in one worldly transaction you suffer a loss, you may repair it
in another; but if you die in enmity with God, and lose your soul, how can you repair the
loss? **_“What exchange can a man give for his soul:"_** (Matt. xvi. 26.) To those who neglect the
care of salvation, St. Euterius says: “ **_Quam pretiosus sis, homo, si Creatori non credis,
interroga Redemptorem."_** (Hom. ii. in Symb.) If, from being created by God to his own image,
you do not comprehend the value of your soul, learn it from Jesus Christ, who has redeemed
you with his own blood. “You were not redeemed with corruptible things, as gold or silver,
but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled." (1 Pet. i. 18, 19.)


3. God, then, sets so high a value on your soul; such is its value in the estimation of Satan,
that, to become master of it, he does not sleep night or day, but is continually going about to
make it his own. Hence St. Augustine exclaims: **_“The enemy sleeps not, and you are asleep."_**
The enemy is always awake to injure you, and you slumber. Pope Benedict the Twelfth, being
asked by a prince for a favour which he could not conscientiously grant, said to the
ambassador: **_Tell the prince, that, if I had two souls, I might be able to lose one of them in
order to please him; but, since I have but one, I cannot consent to lose it. Thus he refused the
favour which the prince sought from him._**


4. Brethren, remember that, if you save your souls, your failure in every worldly transaction
will be but of little importance: for, if you are saved, you shall enjoy complete happiness for



all eternity. But, if you lose your souls, what will it profit you to have enjoyed all the riches,
honours, and amusements of this world? If you lose your souls, all is lost. **_“What doth it
profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his_own soul ?"_** (Matt. xvi.
26.) By this maxim St. Ignatius of Loyola drew many souls to God, and among them the soul
of St. Francis Xavier, who was then at Paris, and devoted his attention to the acquirement of
worldly goods. One day St, Ignatius said to him: **_“Francis, whom do you serve? You serve the
world, which is a traitor, that promises, but does not perform. And if it should fulfil all its
promises, how long do its goods last? Can they last longer than this life? And, after death,
what will they profit you, if you shall not have saved your soul ?"_** He then reminded Francis
of the maxims of the Gospel: **_"What doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and
suffer the loss of his own soul ?"“But one thing is necessary ?"_** (Luke x. 42.) It is not
necessary to become rich on this earth to acquire honours and dignities; but it is necessary to
save our souls; because, unless we gain heaven we shall be condemned to hell: there is no
middle place: we must be either saved or damned. God has not created us for this earth;
neither does he preserve our lives that we may become rich and enjoy amusements. **_"And the
end life everlasting."_** (Hom, vi. 22.) He has created us, and preserved us, that we may acquire
eternal glory.



5. St. Philip Neri used to say, that he who does not seek, above all things, the salvation of his
soul, is a fool. If on this earth there were two classes of men, one mortal, and the other
immortal, and if the former saw the latter entirely devoted to the acquisition of earthly goods,
would they not exclaim: O fools that you are! You have it in your power to secure the
immense and eternal goods of Paradise, and you lose your time in procuring the miserable
goods of this earth, which shall end at death. And for these you expose yourselves to the
danger of the eternal torments of hell. Leave to us, for whom all shall end at death, the care of
these earthly things. But, brethren, we are all immortal, and each of us shall be eternally
happy or eternally miserable in the other life. But the misfortune of the greater part of
mankind is, that they are solicitous about the present, and never think of the, future. ” **_Oh!
that they would be wise, and would understand, and would provide for their last end."_**
(Deut. xxxii. 29.) Oh! that they knew how to detach themselves from present goods, which
last but a short time, and to provide for what must happen after death an eternal reign in
heaven, or everlasting slavery in hell. St. Philip Neri, conversing one day with Francis
Zazzera, a young man of talent who expected to make a fortune in the world, said to him:
**_"You shall realize a great fortune; you shall be a prelate, afterwards a cardinal, and in the
end, perhaps, pope. But what must follow? what must follow? Go, my son, think on these
words."_** The young man departed, and after meditating on the words, **_what must follow?
what must follow?_** he renounced his worldly prospects, and gave himself entirely to God;
and, retiring from the world, he entered into the congregation of St. Philip, and died a holy
death.


6. **_"The fashion of this world passeth away."_** (i Cor. vii. 31.) On this passage, Cornelius à
Lapide , says, that **_"the world is as it were a stage."_** The present life is a comedy, which
passes away. Happy the man who acts his part well in this comedy by saving his soul. But if
he shall have spent his life in the acquisition of riches and worldly honours, he shall justly be
called a fool; and at the hour of death he shall receive the reproach addressed to the rich man
in the gospel: ” **_Fool, this night do they require thy soul of thee; and whose shall these things
be which thou hast provided?"_** (Luke xii 20.) In explaining the words”they require, ” Toletus



says, that **_the Lord has given us our souls to guard them against the assaults of our enemies;
and that at death the angel shall come to require them of us, and shall present them at the
tribunal of Jesus Christ. But if we shall have lost our souls by attending only to the
acquisition of earthly possessions, these shall belong to us no longer they shall pass to other
hands: and what shall then become of our souls?_**



7. Poor worldlings! of all the riches which they acquired, of all the pomps which they
displayed in this life, what shall they find at death? **_They have slept their sleep: and all the
men of riches have found nothing in their hands."_** (Ps. Ixxv. 6.) The dream of this present life
shall be over at death, and they shall have acquired nothing for eternity. Ask of so many
great men of this earth of the princes and emperors, who, during life, have abounded in
riches, honours, and pleasures, and are at this moment in hell what now remains of all the
riches which they possessed in this world? They answer with tears: **_"Nothing, nothing. ”_** -
And of so many honours enjoyed of so many past pleasures of so many pomps and triumphs,
what now remains? They answer with howling: **_"Nothing, nothing. ”_**


8. Justly, then, has St. Francis Xavier said, that in the world there is but one good and one
evil. The former consists in saving our souls; the latter in losing them. Hence, David said:
**_"One thing I have asked of the Lord; this I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord."_** (Ps. xxvi. 4.) One thing only have I sought, and will for ever seek, from God that he
may grant me the grace to save my soul; for, if I save my soul, all is safe; if I lose it, all is lost.
And, what is more important, if my soul be once lost, it is lost for ever. Let us pass to the
second point.


**_Second Point. If the soul be once lost, it is lost for ever._**
9. Men die but once. If a Christian died twice, he might lose his soul the first, and save it the
second time. But we can die only once: if the soul be lost the first time, it is lost for ever. This
truth St. Teresa frequently inculcated to her nuns: "One soul," she would say, **_"one eternity."_**
As if she said: We have but one soul: if this be lost, all is lost. There is but **_"one eternity;"_** if
the soul be once lost, it is lost for ever. ” **_Periisse semel æternum est."_**


10. St. Eucherius says that there is no error so great as the neglect of eternal salvation. **_"Sane
supra omnem errorem est dissimulare negotium æternæ salutis."_** It is an error which
surpasses all errors, because it is irremediable. Other mistakes may be repaired: if a person
loses property in one way, he may acquire it in another; if he loses a situation, a dignity, he
may afterwards recover them; if he even loses his life, provided his soul be saved, all is safe.
But he who loses his soul has no means of repairing the loss. The wailing of the damned
arises from the thought, that for them the time of salvation is over, and that there is no hope
of remedy for their eternal ruin. ” **_The summer is ended, and we are not saved."_** (Jer. viii. 20.)
Hence they weep, and shall inconsolably weep for ever, saying: ” **_Therefore we have erred
from the way of truth, and the light of justice hath not shined unto us."_** (Wis. v. 6.) But what
will it profit them to know the error they have committed, when it will be too late to repair it?


11. The greatest torment of the damned arises from the thought of having lost their souls, and
of having lost them through their own fault. ” **_Destruction is thy own, O Israel; thy help is
only from me."_** (Osee xiii. 9.) O miserable being! God says to each of the damned; thy
perdition is thine own; that is from thyself; by sin thou hast been the cause of thy damnation;



for I was ready to save thee if thou hadst wished to attend to thy salvation. St. Teresa used to
say, that when a person loses a trifle through negligence, his peace is disturbed by the
thought of having lost it through his own fault. O God! what shall be the pain which each of
the damned shall feel on entering into hell, at the thought of having lost his soul his all and of
having lost them through his own fault!



12. "We must, then, from this day forward, devote all our attention to the salvation of our
souls. There is no question, says St. John Chrysostom, of losing some earthly good which we
must one day relinquish. But there is question of losing Paradise, and of going to suffer for
ever in hell: ” **_De immortalibus suppliciis, de cœlestis regni amissione res agitur."_** We must
fear and tremble; it is thus we shall be able to secure eternal happiness. **_“With fear and
trembling work out your salvation. ”_** (Phil. ii. 12.) Hence, if we wish to save our souls, we
must labour strenuously to avoid dangerous occasions, to resist temptations, and to frequent
the sacraments. Without labour we cannot obtain heaven. **_“The violent bear it away."_** The
saints tremble at the thought of eternity. St. Andrew Avellino exclaimed with tears: **_Who
knows whether I shall be saved or damned?_** St. Lewis Bertrand said with trembling: **_What
shall be my lot in the other world?_** And shall we not tremble? Let us pray to Jesus Christ and
his most holy mother to help us to save our souls. This is for us the most important of all
affairs: if we succeed in it, we shall be eternally happy; if we fail, we must be for ever
miserable.


**SERMON XIII-SEXAGESIMA SUNDAY. - ON THE UNHAPPY LIFE OF SINNERS, AND
ON THE HAPPY LIFE OF THOSE WHO LOVE GOD.**
**_" And that which fell among the thorns are they who have heard, and, going their way, are
choked with the cares and riches of this life, and yield no fruit." LUKE viii. 14._**


IN the parable of this day’s gospel we are told that part of the seed which the sower went out
to sow fell among thorns. The Saviour has declared that the seed represents the divine word,
and the thorns the attachment of men to earthly riches and pleasures, which are the thorns
that prevent the fruit of the word of God, not only in the future, but even in the present life.
misery of poor sinners! By their sins they not only condemn themselves to eternal torments in
the next, but to an unhappy life in this world. This is what I intend to demonstrate in the
following discourse.
First Point. The unhappy life of sinners.
Second Point. Happy life of those who love God.


**_First Point. Unhappy life of sinners._**
1. The devil deceives sinners, and makes them imagine that, by indulging their sensual
appetites, they shall lead a life of happiness, and shall enjoy peace. But there is no peace for
those who offend God. ” **_There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord. ”_** (Isa. xlviii. 22.) God
declares that all his enemies have led a life of misery, and that they have not even known the
way of peace. ” **_Destruction and unhappiness in their ways: and the way of peace they have
not known."_** (Ps. xiii. 3.)


2. Brute animals that have been created for this world, enjoy peace in sensual delights. Give
to a dog a bone, and he is perfectly content; give to an ox a bundle of hay, and he desires
nothing more. But man, who has been created for God, to love God, and to be united to him,



can be made happy only by God, and not by the world, though it should enrich him with all
its goods. What are worldly goods? They may be all reduced to pleasures of sense, to riches,
and to honours. **_“All that is in the world,"_** says St. John, ” **_is the concupiscence of the flesh,"_**
or sensual delights, and “ **_the concupiscence of the eyes,"_** or riches, and “ **_the pride of life"_** that
is, earthly honours. (1 John ii. 16.) St. Bernard says, that a man may be puffed up with earthly
goods, but can never be made content or happy by them. ” **_Inflari potest, satiari, non potest_** ."
And how can earth and wind and dung satisfy the heart of man? In his comment on these
words of St. Peter” **_Behold, we have left all things"_** the same saint says, **_that he saw in the
world different classes of fools. All had a great desire of happiness. Some, such as the
avaricious, were content with riches; others, Ambitious of honours and of praise, were
satisfied with wind; others, seated round a furnace, swallowed the sparks that were thrown
from it these were the passionate and vindictive; others, in fine, drank fetid water from a
stagnant pool and these were the voluptuous and unchaste. O fools! adds the saint, do you
not perceive that all these things, from which you seek content, do not satisfy, but, on the
contrary, increase the cravings of your heart?”Hæc potius famem provocant, quam
extinguunt."_** Of this we have a striking example in Alexander the Great, who, after having
conquered half the world, burst into tears, because he was not master of the whole earth.



3. Many expect to find peace in accumulating riches; but how can these satisfy their
desires?” **_Major pecunia,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_avaritiæ fauces non claudit, sed extendit."_** A
large quantity of money does not close, but rather extends, the jaws of avarice; that is, the
enjoyment of riches excites, rather than satiates, the desire of wealth. ” **_Thou wast debased
even to hell; thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways; yet thou saidst not, I will
rest. ”_** (Isa. Ivii. 9, 10.) Poor worldlings! they labour and toil to acquire an increase of wealth
and property, but never enjoy repose: the more they accumulate riches, the greater their
disquietude and vexation. **_"The rich have wanted, and have suffered hunger; but they that
seek the Lord shall not be deprived of any good. ”_** (Ps. xxxiii. 11.) The rich of this world are, of
all men, the most miserable; because, the more they possess, the more they desire to possess.
They never succeed in attaining all the objects of their wishes, and therefore they are far
poorer than men who have but a competency, and seek God alone. These are truly rich,
because they are content with their condition, and find in God every good. ” **_They that seek
the Lord shall not be deprived of any good."_** To the saints, because they possess God, nothing
is wanting; to the worldly rich, who are deprived of God, all things are wanting, because they
want peace. The appellation of **_fool_** was, therefore, justly given to the rich man in the gospel
(Luke xii. 19), who, because his land brought forth plenty of fruits, said to his soul: **_"Soul,
thou hast much goods laid up for many years: take rest, eat, drink, make good cheer."_** (Luke
xii. 19.) But this man was called a fool. ” **_Thou fool, this night do they require thy soul of thee;
and whose shall those things be which thou hast provided ?"_** (v. 20.) And why was he called
a fool. Because he imagined that by these goods by eating and drinking he should be content,
and should enjoy peace. **_"Rest,"_** he said, **_“eat, drink." "Num quid, ”_** says St. Basil of Seleucia,
**_"animam porcinam habes ?" Hast thou the soul of a brute, that thou expectest to make it
happy by eating and drinking?_**


4. But, perhaps sinners who seek after and attain worldly honours are content? All the
honours of this earth are but smoke and wind ( **_"Ephraim feedeth on the wind"_** Osee xii. 1),
and how can these content the heart of a Christian? **_“The pride of them,"_** says David,
**_“ascendeth continually."_** (Ps. lxxiii. 23.) The ambitious are not satisfied by the attainment of



certain honours: their ambition and pride continually increase; and thus their disquietude,
their envy, and their fears are multiplied.



5. They who live in the habit of sins of impurity, feed, as the Prophet Jeremiah says, on dung.
**_“Qui voluptuose vescebantur, amplexati sunt stercora."_** (Thren. iv. 5.) How can dung content
or give peace to the soul? Ah! what peace, what peace can sinners at a distance from God
enjoy? They may possess the riches, honours, and delights of this world; but they never shall
have peace. No; the word of God cannot fail: he has declared that there is no peace for his
enemies. ” **_There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord. ”_** (Isaias, xlviii. 22.) **_Poor sinners!
they,_** as St. Chrysostom says, **_always carry about with them their own executioner that is, a
guilty conscience, which continually torments them. ”Peccator conscientiam quasi
carnificem circumgestat."_** (Serm. x. do Laz.) St. Isidore asserts, that there is no pain more
excruciating than that of a guilty conscience. Hence he adds, that he who leads a good life is
never sad. ” **_Nulla pœna gravior pœna conscientiæ: vis nunquam esse tristis? bene vive."_** (S.
Isid., lib. 2, Solit.)


6. In describing the deplorable state of sinners, the Holy Ghost compares them, to a sea
continually tossed by the tempest. **_"The wicked are like the raging sea, which cannot rest."_**
(Isa. Ivii. 20.) Waves come and go, but they are all waves of bitterness and rancour; for every
cross and contradiction disturbs and agitates the wicked. If a person at a ball or musical
exhibition, were obliged to remain suspended by a cord with his head downwards, could he
feel happy at the entertainment? Such is the state of a Christian in enmity with God: his soul
is as it were turned upside down; instead of being united with God and detached from
creatures, it is united with creatures and separated from God. But creatures, says St. Vincent
Ferrer, are without, and do not enter to content the heart, which God alone can make happy.
**_“Non intrant ibi ubi est sitis."_** The sinner is like a man parched with thirst, and standing in
the middle of a fountain: because the waters which surround him do not enter to satisfy his
thirst, he remains in the midst of them more thirsty than before.


7. Speaking of the unhappy life which he led when he was in a state of sin, David said: ”My
tears have been my bread, day and night, whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God ?"
(Ps. xli. 4.) To relieve himself, he went to his villas, to his gardens, to musical entertainments,
and to various other royal amusements, but they all said to him: "David, if thou expectest
comfort from us, thou art deceived. "Where is thy God? Go and seek thy God, whom thou
hast lost; for he alone can restore thy peace." Hence David confessed that, in the midst of his
princely wealth, he enjoyed no repose, and that he wept night and day. Let us now listen to
his son Solomon, who acknowledged that he indulged his senses in whatsoever they desired.
**_"Whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not_**. **_"_** (Eccl. ii. 10.) But, after all his sensual
enjoyments, he exclaimed: ” **_Vanity of vanities :... behold all is vanity and affliction of
spirit."_** (Eccles. i. 2 and 14.) Mark! he declares that all the pleasures of this earth are not only
vanity of vanities, but also affliction of spirit. And this sinners well know from experience;
for sin brings with it the fear of divine vengeance. The man who is encompassed by powerful
enemies never sleeps in peace; and can the sinner, who has God for an enemy, enjoy
tranquillity?” **_Fear to them that work evil."_** (Prov. x. 29.) The Christian who commits a mortal
sin feels himself oppressed with fear every leaf that moves excites terror. ” **_The sound of dread
is always in his ears."_** (Job xv. 21.) He appears to be always flying away, although no one
pursues him. ” **_The wicked man fleeth when no man pursueth."_** (Prov. xxviii. 1.) He shall be



persecuted, not by men, but by his own sin. It was thus with Cain, who, after having killed
his brother Abel, was seized with fear, and said: ”Every one, therefore, that findeth me shall
kill me." (Gen. iv. 14.) The Lord assured him that no one should injure him: ” **_The Lord said to
him: ”No; it shall not be so”_** (v. 15.) But, notwithstanding this assurance, Cain, pursued by
his own sins, was, as the Scripture attests, always flying from one place to another **_“He dwelt
a fugitive on the earth."_** (v. 16.)



8. Moreover, sin brings with it remorse of conscience that cruel worm that gnaws incessantly,
and never dies. ” **_Their worm shall not die."_** (Isa Ixvi. 24.) If the sinner goes to a festival, to a
comedy, to a banquet, his conscience continually reproaches him, saying: Unhappy man! you
have lost God; if you were now to die, what should become of you? The torture of remorse of
conscience, even in the present life, is so great that, to free themselves from it, some persons
have put an end to their lives Judas, through despair, hanged himself. A certain man who
had killed an infant, was so much tormented with remorse that he could not rest. To rid
himself of it he entered into a monastery; but finding no peace even there, he went before a
judge, acknowledged his crime, and got himself condemned to death.


9. God complains of the injustice of sinners in leaving him, who is the fountain of all
consolation, to plunge themselves into fetid and broken cisterns, which can give no peace**_.
”For my people have done two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and
have digged to themselves cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water."_** (Jer. ii. 13.) You
have, the Lord says to sinners, refused to serve me, your God, in peace. Unhappy creatures!
you shall serve your enemies in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and in want of every
kind. **_“Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joy and gladness, .... thou shalt
serve thy enemy in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness, and in want of all things."_** (Deut.
xxviii. 47, 48.) This is what sinners experience every day. What do not the vindictive endure
after they have satisfied their revenge by the murder of an enemy? They fly continually from
the relations of their murdered foe, and from the minister of justice. They live as fugitives,
poor, afflicted, and abandoned by all. What do not the voluptuous and unchaste suffer in
order to gratify their wicked desires? What do not the avaricious suffer in order to acquire
the possessions of others? Ah! if they suffered for God what they suffer for sin, they would
lay up great treasures for eternity, and would lead a life of peace and happiness: but, by
living in sin, they lead a life of misery here, to lead a still more miserable life for eternity
hereafter. Hence they weep continually in hell, saying: **_“We wearied ourselves in the way of
iniquity and destruction, and have walked through hard ways."_** (Wis. v. 7.) We have, they
exclaim, walked through hard ways, through paths covered with thorns. We wearied
ourselves in the way of iniquity: we have laboured hard: we have sweated blood: we have
led a life full of misery, of gall, and of poison. And why? To bring ourselves to a still more
wretched life in this pit of fire.


**_Second Point. The happy life of those who love God._**


10. **_“Justice and peace have kissed."_** (Ps. lxxxiv. 11.) Peace resides in every soul in which
justice dwells. Hence David said: **_"Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of
thy heart."_** (Ps. xxxvi. 4.) To understand this text, we must consider that worldlings seek to
satisfy the desires of their hearts with the goods of this earth; but, because these cannot make
them happy, their hearts continually make fresh demands; and, how much soever they may



acquire of these goods, they are not content. Hence the Prophet says: ” **_Delight in the Lord,
and he will give thee the requests of thy heart."_** Give up creatures, seek your delight in God,
and he will satisfy all the cravings of your heart.



11. This is what happened to St. Augustine, who, as long as he sought happiness in creatures,
never enjoyed peace; but, as soon as he renounced them, and gave to God all the affections of
his heart, he exclaimed: “ **_All things are hard, O Lord, and thou alone art repose._** " As if he
said: Ah! Lord, I now know my folly. I expected to find felicity in earthly pleasures; but now I
know that they are only vanity and affliction of spirit, and that thou alone art the peace and
joy of our hearts.


12. The Apostle says, that the peace which God gives to those who love, surpasses all the
sensual delights which a man can enjoy on this earth. ” **_The peace of God, which surpasseth
all understanding. ”_** (Phil. iv. 7.) St. Francis of Assisium, in saying **_“My God and my all,"_**
experienced on this earth an anticipation of Paradise. St. Francis Xavier, in the midst of his
labours in India for the glory of Jesus Christ, was so replenished with divine consolations,
that he exclaimed: **_"Enough, Lord, enough."_** Where, I ask, has any lover of this world been
found, so satisfied with the possessions of worldly goods, as to say: Enough, O world,
enough; no more riches, no more honours, no more applause, no more pleasures? Ah, no!
worldlings are constantly seeking after higher honours, greater riches, and new delights; but
the more they have of them, the less are their desires satisfied, and the greater their
disquietude.


13. It is necessary to persuade ourselves of this truth, that God alone can give content.
"Worldlings do not wish to be convinced of it, through an apprehension that, if they give
themselves to God, they shall lead a life of bitterness and discontent. But, with the Royal
Prophet, I say to them: ” **_taste, and see that the Lord is sweet."_** (Ps. xxxiii. 9.) Why, sinners,
will you despise and regard as miserable that life which you have not as yet tried?” **_taste and
see."_** Begin to make a trial of it; hear Mass every day; practise mental prayer and the
visitation of the most holy sacrament; go to communion at least once a week; fly from evil
conversations; walk always with God; and you shall see that, by such a life, you will enjoy
that sweetness and peace which the world, with all its delights, has not hitherto been able to
give you.


**SERMON XIV. QUINQUAGESIMA SUNDAY. - DELUSIONS OF SINNERS.**
**_"Lord, that I may see." LUKE xviii. 41._**


1. THE Devil brings sinners to hell by closing their eyes to the dangers of perdition. He first
blinds them, and then leads them with himself to eternal torments. If, then, we wish to be
saved, we must continually pray to God in the words of the blind man in the gospel of this
day, ” **_Lord, that I may see."_** Give me light: make me see the way in which I must walk in
order to save my soul, and to escape the deceits of the enemy of salvation. I shall, brethren,
this day place before your eyes the delusion by which the devil tempts men to sin and to
persevere in sin, that you may know how to guard yourselves against his deceitful artifices.


2. To understand these delusions better, let us imagine the case of a young man who, seized
by some passion, lives in sin, the slave of Satan, and never thinks of his eternal salvation. My



son, I say to him, what sort of life do you lead? If you continue to live in this manner, how
will you be able to save your soul? But, behold! the devil, on the other hand, says to him:
Why should you be afraid of being lost? Indulge your passions for the present: you will
afterwards confess your sins, and thus all shall be remedied. Behold the net by which the
devil drags so many souls into hell. **_“Indulge your passions: you will hereafter make a good
confession."_** But, in reply, I say, that in the meantime you lose your soul. Tell me: if you had a
jewel worth a thousand pounds, would you throw it into a river with the hope of afterwards
finding it again? What if all your efforts to find it were fruitless? God! you hold in your hand
the invaluable jewel of your soul, which Jesus Christ has purchased with his own blood, and
you cast it into hell! Yes; you cast it into hell; because according to the present order of
providence, for every mortal sin you commit, your name is written among the number of the
damned. But you say. ” **_I hope to recover God‟s grace by making a good confession."_** And if
you should not recover it, what shall be the consequences? To make a good confession, a true
sorrow for sin is necessary, and this sorrow is the gift of God: if he does not give it, will you
not be lost for ever?



3. You rejoin: ” **_I am young; God compassionates my youth; I will hereafter give myself to
God."_** Behold another delusion! You are young; but do you not know that God counts, not
the years, but the sins of each individual? You are young; but how many sins have you
committed? Perhaps there are many persons of a very advanced age, who have not been
guilty of the fourth part of the sins which you have committed. And do you not know that
God has fixed for each of us the number of sins which he will pardon?” **_The Lord patiently
expecteth, that, when the day of judgment shall come, he may punish them in the fulness of
their sins."_** (2 Mach. vi. 14.) God has patience, and waits for a while; but, when the measure
of the sins which he has determined to pardon is tilled up, he pardons no more, but chastises
the sinner, by suddenly depriving him of life in the miserable state of sin, or by abandoning
him in his sin, and executing that threat which he made by the prophet Isaias” **_I shall take
away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted."_** (Isa. v. 5.) If a person has cultivated land for
many years, has encompassed it with a hedge for its protection, and expended a large sum of
money on it, but finds that, after all, it produces no fruit, what will he do with it? He will
pluck up the hedge, and abandon it to all men and beasts that may wish to enter. Tremble,
then, lest God should treat you in a similar manner. If you do not give up sin, your remorse
of conscience and your fear of divine chastisement shall daily increase. Behold the hedge
taken away, and your soul abandoned by God a punishment worse than death itself.


4. You say: ” **_I cannot at present resist this passion."_** Behold the third delusion of the devil,
by which he makes you believe that at present you have not strength to overcome certain
temptations. But St. Paul tells us that God is faithful, and that he never permits us to be
tempted above our strength. **_"And God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted
above that which you are able."_** (1 Cor. x. 13.) I ask, if you are not now able to resist the
temptation, how can you expect to resist it hereafter? If you yield to it, the Devil will become
stronger, and you shall become weaker; and if you be not now able to extinguish this flame of
passion, how can you hope to be able to extinguish it when it shall have grown more violent?
You say: **_"God will give me his aid."_** But this aid God is ready to give at present if you ask it.
Why then do you not implore his assistance? Perhaps you expect that, without now taking
the trouble of invoking his aid, you will receive from him increased helps and graces, after
you shall have multiplied the number of your sins? Perhaps you doubt the veracity of God,



who has promised to give whatever we ask of him?” **_Ask,"_** he says, ” **_and it shall be given
you."_** (Matt. vii. 7.) God cannot violate his promises. ” **_God is not as man, that he should lie,
nor as the son of man, that he should be changed. Hath he said, then, and will he not do ?"_**
(Num. xxiii. 19.) Have recourse to him, and he will give you the strength necessary to resist
the temptation. God commands you to resist it, and you say: ” **_I have not strength."_** Does
God, then, command impossibilities? No; the Council of Trent has declared that” **_God does
not command impossibilities; but, by his commands, he admonishes you to do what you can,
and to ask what you cannot do; and he assists, that you may be able to do it."_** (Sess. 6. c.
xiii.) When you see that you have not sufficient strength to resist temptation with the
ordinary assistance of God, ask of him the additional help which you require, and he will
give it to you; and thus you shall be able to conquer all temptations, however violent they
may be.



5. But you will not pray; and you say that at present you will commit this sin, and will
afterwards confess it. But, I ask, how do you know that God will give you time to confess it?
You say: ” **_I will go to confession before the lapse of a week."_** And who has promised you this
week? Well, then you say: ” **_I will go to confession tomorrow."_** And who promises you
tomorrow? **_“Crastinum Deus non promisit,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_fortasse dabit, et fortasse
non dabit." God has not promised you to-morrow. Perhaps he will give it, and perhaps he
will refuse it to you,_** as he has to so many others. How many have gone to bed in good
health, and have been found dead in the morning! How many, in the very act of sin, has the
Lord struck dead and sent to hell! Should this happen to you, how will you repair your
eternal ruin?” **_Commit this sin, and confess it afterwards."_** Behold the deceitful artifice by
which the devil has brought so many thousands of Christians to hell. We scarcely ever find a
Christian so sunk in despair as to intend to damn himself. All the wicked sin with the hope of
afterwards going to confession. But, by this illusion, how many have brought themselves to
perdition! For them there is now no time for confession, no remedy for their damnation.


6. ” **_But God is merciful."_** Behold another common delusion by which the devil encourages
sinners to persevere in a life of sin! A certain author has said, that more souls have been sent
to hell by the mercy of God than by his justice. This is indeed the case; for men are induced
by the deceits of the devil to persevere in sin, through confidence in Gods mercy; and thus
they are lost. **_"God is merciful."_** Who denies it? But, great as his mercy, how many does he
every day send to hell? God is merciful, but he is also just, and is, therefore, obliged to punish
those who offend him. ” **_And his mercy,"_** says the divine mother, ” **_to them that fear him."_**
(Luke i. 50.) But with regard to those who abuse his mercy and despise him, he exercises
justice. The Lord pardons sins, but he cannot pardon the determination to commit sin. St.
Augustine says, that he who sins with the intention of repenting after his sins, is not a
penitent but a scoffer. ” **_Irrisor est non pœnitens."_** But the Apostle tells us that God will not be
mocked**_. ”Be not deceived; God is not mocked."_** (Gal. vi. 7.) It would be a mockery of God to
insult him as often and as much as you pleased, and afterwards to expect eternal glory.


7. **_"But”;_** you say, **_"as God has shown me so many mercies hitherto, I hope he will continue
to do so for the future."_** Behold another delusion! Then, because God has not as yet chastised
your sins, he will never punish them! On the contrary, the greater have been his mercies, the
more you should tremble, lest, if you offend him again, he should pardon you no more, and
should take vengeance on your sins. Behold the advice of the Holy Ghost: ” **_Say not: I have_**



**_sinned, and what harm hath befallen me? for the Most High is a patient rewarder."_** (Eccles. v.
4.) Do not say: ” **_I have sinned, and no chastisement has fallen upon me."_** God bears for a
time, but not for ever. He waits for a certain time; but when that arrives, he then chastises the
sinner for all his past iniquities: and the longer he has waited for repentance, the more severe
the chastisement**_. ”Quos diutius expectat,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_durius damnat."_** Then, my
brother, since you know that you have frequently offended God, and that he has not sent you
to hell, you should exclaim: ” **_The mercies of the Lord, that we are not consumed."_** (Thren. iii.
22.) Lord, I thank you for not having sent me to hell, which I have so often deserved. And
therefore you ought to give yourself entirely to God, at least through gratitude, and should
consider that, for less sins than you have committed, many are now in that pit of fire, without
the smallest hope of being ever released from it. The patience of God in bearing with you,
should teach you not to despise him still more, but to love and serve him with greater
fervour, and to atone, by penitential austerities and by other holy works, for the insults you
have offered to him. You know that he has shown mercies to you, which he has not shown to
others. ”He hath not done in like manner to every nation." (Ps. cxlvii. 20.) Hence you should
tremble, lest, if you commit a single additional mortal sin, God should abandon you, and cast
you into hell.



8. Let us come to the next illusion. **_“It is true that, by this sin, I lose the grace of God; but,
even after committing this sin, I may be saved."_** You may, indeed, be saved: but it cannot be
denied that if, after having committed so many sins, and after having received so many
graces from God, you again offend him, there is great reason to fear that you shall be lost.
Attend to the words of the sacred Scripture: **_“A hard heart shall fare evil at the last."_** (Eccles.
iii. 27.) The obstinate sinner shall die an unhappy death. **_Evil doers shall be cut off."_** (Ps.
xxxvi. 9.) The wicked shall be cut off by the divine justice. **_“For what things a man shall sow,
those also shall he reap."_** (Gal. vi. 8.) He that sows in sin, shall reap eternal torments.
**_“Because I called and you refused, I also will laugh in your destruction and will mock when
that shall come to you which you feared."_** (Prov. i. 24, 26.) I called, says the Lord, and you
mocked me; but I will mock you at the hour of death. **_“Revenge is mine, and I will repay
them in due time."_** (Deut. xxxii. 35.) The chastisement of sins belongs to me, and I will execute
vengeance on them when the time of vengeance shall arrive. **_“The man that with a stiff neck
despiseth him that reproveth him, shall suddenly be destroyed, and health shall not follow
him."_** _(_ Prov. xxix. 1.) The man who obstinately despises those who correct him, shall be
punished with a sudden death, and for him there shall be no hope of salvation.


9. Now, brethren, what think you of these divine threats against sinners? Is it easy, or is it not
very difficult, to save your souls, if, after so many divine calls, and after so many mercies,
you continue to offend God? You say: **_“But after all, it may happen that I will save my
soul."_** I answer: "What folly is it to trust your salvation to a perhaps? How many with this
**_“perhaps I may be saved,"_** are now in hell? Do you wish to be one of their unhappy
companions? Dearly beloved Christians, enter into yourselves, and tremble; for this sermon
may be the last of Gods mercies to you.


**SERMON XV. FIRST SUNDAY OF LENT. - ON THE NUMBER OF SINS BEYOND
WHICH GOD PARDONS NO MORE.**
**_" Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." MATT. iv. 7._**



IN this days gospel we read that, having gone into the desert, Jesus Christ permitted the
devil to” **_set him upon the pinnacle of the temple,"_** and say to him **_: "If thou be the Son of God,
cast thyself down ;" for the angels shall preserve thee from all injury._** But the Lord answered
that, in the Sacred Scriptures it is written: **_“Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."_** The
sinner who abandons himself to sin without striving to resist temptations, or without at least
asking God’s help to conquer them, and hopes that the Lord will one day draw him from the
precipice, tempts God to work miracles, or rather to show to him an extraordinary mercy not
extended to the generality of Christians. God, as the Apostle says, ”will have all men to be
saved," (1 Tim. ii. 4); but he also wishes us all to labour for our own salvation, at least by
adopting the means of overcoming our enemies, and of obeying him when he calls us to
repentance. Sinners hear the calls of God, but they forget them, and continue to offend him.
But God does not forget them. He numbers the graces which he dispenses, as well as the sins
which we commit. Hence, when the time which he has fixed arrives, God deprives us of his
graces, and begins to inflict chastisement. I intend to show, in this discourse, that, when sins
reach a certain number, God pardons no more. Be attentive.



1. St. Basil, St. Jerome, St. John Chrysostom, St. Augustine, and other fathers, teach that, as
God (according to the words of Scripture, ” **_Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and
number, and weight”_** (Wis. xi. 21), has fixed for each person the number of the days of his life,
and the degrees of health and talent which he will give him, so he has also determined for
each the number of sins which he will pardon; and when this number is completed, he will
pardon no more. ” **_Illud sentire nos convenit,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_tamdiu unumquemque a
Dei patientia sustineri, quo consummate nullam illi veniam reserveri_** ." (De Vita Christi, cap.
iii.) Eusebius of Cesarea says: ” **_Deus expectat usque ad certum numerum et postea deserit."_**
(Lib. 8, cap. ii.) The same doctrine is taught by the above- mentioned fathers.


2. ” **_The Lord hath sent me to heal the contrite of heart."_** (Isa. Ixi. 1.) God is ready to heal
those who sincerely wish to amend their lives, but cannot take pity on the obstinate sinner
The Lord pardons sins, but he cannot pardon those who are determined to offend him. Nor
can we demand from God a reason why he pardons one a hundred sins, and takes others out
of life, and sends them to hell, after three or four sins. By his Prophet Amos, God has said:
” **_For three crimes of Damascus, and for four, I will not convert it."_** (i. 3.) In this we must
adore the judgments of God, and say with the Apostle: ” **_the depth of the riches, of the
wisdom, and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments. ”_** (Rom. xi.
33.) He who receives pardon, says St. Augustine, is pardoned through the pure mercy of
God; and they who are chastised are justly punished. ” **_Quibus datur misericordia, gratis
datur: quibus non datur ex justitia non datur."_** (1 de Corrept.) How many has God sent to
hell for the first offence? St. Gregory relates, that a child of five years, who had arrived at the
use of reason, for having uttered a blasphemy, was seized by the devil and carried to hell.
The divine mother revealed to that great servant of God, Benedicta of Florence, that a boy of
twelve years was damned after the first sin. Another boy of eight years died after his first sin
and was lost. You say: I am young: there are many who have committed more sins than I
have. But is God on that account obliged to wait for your repentance if you offend him? In
the gospel of St. Matthew (xxi. 19) we read, that the Saviour cursed a fig tree the first time he
saw it without fruit. ” **_May no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And immediately the
fig tree withered away."_** You must, then, tremble at the thought of committing a single
mortal sin, particularly if you have already been guilty of mortal sins.



### 


3. ” **_Be not without fear about sins forgiven, and add not sin to sin."_** (Eccl. v. 5.) Say not then,
O sinner; As God has forgiven me other sins, so he will pardon me this one if I commit it. Say
not this; for, if to the sin which has been forgiven you add another, you have reason to fear
that this new sin shall be united to your former guilt, and that thus the number will be
completed, and that you shall be abandoned. Behold how the Scripture unfolds this truth
more clearly in another place. **_"The Lord patiently expecteth, that when the day of judgment
shall come, he may punish them in the fullness of sins."_** (2 Mac. vi. 14.) God waits with
patience until a certain number of sins is committed, but, when the measure of guilt is filled
up, he waits no longer, but chastises the sinner. **_"Thou hast sealed up my offences as it were
in a bag."_** (Job xiv. 17.) Sinners multiply their sins without keeping any account of them; but
God numbers them that, when the harvest is ripe, that is, when the number of sins is
completed, he may take vengeance on them. ” **_Put ye in the sickles, for the harvest is ripe."_**
(Joel iii. 13.)



4. Of this there are many examples in the Scriptures. Speaking of the Hebrews, the Lord in
one place says: ” **_All the men that have tempted me now ten times.... shall not see the land. ”_**
(Num. xiv. 22, 23.) In another place he says, that he restrained his vengeance against the
Amorrhites, because the number of their sins was not completed. ” **_For as yet the iniquities of
the Amorrhites are not at the full."_** (Gen. xv. 16.) We have again the example of Saul, who,
after having disobeyed God a second time, was abandoned. He entreated Samuel to interpose
before the Lord in his behalf. **_“Bear, I beseech thee, my sin, and return with me, that I may
adore the Lord,"_** (1 Kings xv. 25.) But, knowing that God had abandoned Saul, Samuel
answered: ”I will not return with thee; because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and
the Lord hath rejected thee," etc. (v. 26.) Saul, you have abandoned God, and he has
abandoned you. We have another example in Balthassar, who, after having profaned the
vessels of the temple, saw a hand writing on the wall, **_"Mane, Thecel, Phares."_** Daniel was
requested to expound the meaning of these words. In explaining the word Thecel, he said to
the king: **_“Thou art weighed in the balance, and art found wanting._** " (Dan. v 27.) By this
explanation he gave the king to understand that the weight of his sins in the balance of divine
justice had made the scale descend. ”The same night, Balthassar, the Chaldean king, was
killed." (Dan. v. 30.) Oh! how many sinners have met with a similar fate! Continuing to
offend God till their sins amounted to a certain number they have been struck dead and sent
to hell. **_“They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell."_** (Job xxi.
13.) Tremble, brethren, lest, if you commit another mortal sin, God should cast you into hell.


5. If God chastised sinners the moment they insult him, we should not see him so much
despised. But, because he does not instantly punish their transgressions, and because,
through mercy, he restrains his anger and waits for their return, they are encouraged to
continue to offend him. **_“For, because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil,
the children of men commit evil without any fear."_** (Eccles. viii. 11.) But it is necessary to be
persuaded that, though God bears with us, he does not wait, nor bear with us for ever.
Expecting, as on former occasions, to escape from the snares of the Philistines, Samson
continued to allow himself to be deluded by Dalila. **_“I will go out as I did before, and shake
myself. ”_** (Judges xvi. 20.) But” **_the Lord was departed from him."_** Samson was at length taken
by his enemies, and lost his life. The Lord warns you not to say: I have committed so many
sins, and God has not chastised me” **_Say not: I have sinned, and what harm hath befallen me?_**



**_for the Most High is a patient rewarder."_** (Eccl. v. 4.) God has patience for a certain term,
after which he punishes the first and last sins. And the greater has been his patience, the
more severe his vengeance



6. Hence, according to St. Chrysostom, God is more to be feared when he bears with sinners
than when he instantly punishes their sins. ” **_Plus timendum est, cum tolerat quam cum
festinanter punit."_** And why? Because, says St. Gregory, **_they to whom God has shown most
mercy, shall, if they do not cease to offend him, be chastised with the greatest rigour. ”Quos
diutius expectat durius damnat."_** The saint adds that **_God often punishes such sinners with a
sudden death, and does not allow them time for repentance. ”Sæpe qui diu tolerati sunt
subita morte rapiuntur, ut nec flere ante mortem liceat."_** And the greater the light which God
gives to certain sinners for their correction, the greater is their blindness and obstinacy in sin.
**_"For it had been better for them not to have known the way of justice, than, after they had
known it, to turn back."_** (2 Pet. ii. 21.) Miserable the sinners who, after having been
enlightened, return to the vomit. St Paul says, that it is morally impossible for them to be
again converted. ” **_For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated have tasted also
the heavenly gifts, ... and are fallen away, to be renewed again to penance."_** (Heb. vi. 4, 6.)


7. Listen, then, sinner, to the admonition of the Lord: ” **_My son, hast thou sinned? Do so no
more, but for thy former sins pray that they may be forgiven thee."_** (Eccl. xxi. 1.) Son, add not
sins to those which you have already committed, but be careful to pray for the pardon of
your past transgressions; otherwise, if you commit another mortal sin, the gates of the divine
mercy may be closed against you, and your soul may be lost forever. When, then, beloved
brethren, the devil tempts you again to yield to sin, say to yourself: If God pardons me no
more, what shall become of me for all eternity? Should the Devil, in reply, say: ”Fear not,
God is merciful ;" answer him by saying: What certainty or what probability have I, that, if I
return again to sin, God will show me mercy or grant me pardon? Because the threat of the
Lord against all who despise his calls: **_"Behold I have called and you refused... I also will
laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared."_**
(Prov. i. 24, 26.) Mark the words I also; they mean that, as you have mocked the Lord by
betraying him again after your confession and promises of amendment, so he will mock you
at the hour of death. ” **_I will laugh and will mock."_** But” **_God is not mocked."_** (Gal. vi. 7.) “ **_As
a dog,"_** says the Wise Man, ” **_that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his
folly."_** (Prov. xxvi. 11.) B. Denis the Carthusian gives an excellent exposition of this text. He
says that, **_as a dog that eats what he has just vomited, is an object of disgust and
abomination, so the sinner who returns to the sins which he has detested and confessed,
becomes hateful in the sight of God. ”Sicut id quod per vomitum est rejectum, resumere est
valide abominabile ac turpe sic peccata deleta reiterari."_**


8. O folly of sinners! If you purchase a house, you spare no pains to get all the securities
necessary to guard against the loss of your money; if you take medicine, you are careful to
assure yourself that it cannot injure you; if you pass over a river, you cautiously avoid all
danger of falling into it; and for a transitory enjoyment, for the gratification of revenge, for a
beastly pleasure, which lasts but a moment, you risk your eternal salvation, saying: _"I will go
to confession after I commit this sin."_ And when, I ask, are you to go to confession? You say:
” **_On tomorrow."_** But who promises you tomorrow? Who assures you that you shall have
time for confession, and that God will not deprive you of life, as he has deprived so many



others, in the act of sin?” **_Diem tenes,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_qui horam non tenes."_** You cannot
be certain of living for another hour, and you say: ” **_I will go to confession to-morrow."_**
Listen to the words of St. Gregory: ” **_He who has promised pardon to penitents, has not
promised tomorrow to sinners."_** (Hom. xii. in Evan). God has promised pardon to all who
repent; but he has not promised to wait till tomorrow for those who insult him. Perhaps God
will give you time for repentance, perhaps he will not. But, should he not give it, what shall
become of your soul? In the meantime, for the sake of a miserable pleasure, you lose the
grace of God, and expose yourself to the danger of being lost for ever.



9. Would you, for such transient enjoyments, risk your money, your honour, your
possessions, your liberty, and your life? No, you would not. How then does it happen that,
for a miserable gratification, you lose your soul, heaven, and God? Tell me: do you believe
that heaven, hell, eternity, are truths of faith? Do you believe that, if you die in sin, you are
lost for ever? Oh! what temerity, what folly is it, to condemn yourself voluntarily to an
eternity of torments with the hope of afterwards reversing the sentence of your
condemnation! **_"Nemo,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_sub spe salutis vult ægrotare."_** No one can be
found so foolish as to take poison with the hope of preventing its deadly effects by adopting
the ordinary remedies. And you will condemn yourself to hell, saying that you expect to be
afterwards preserved from it. folly! which, in conformity with the divine threats, has brought,
and brings every day, so many to hell. “ **_Thou hast trusted in thy wickedness, and evil shall
come upon thee, and thou shalt not know the rising thereof."_** (Isa. xlvii. 10, 11.) You have
sinned, trusting rashly in the divine mercy: the punishment of your guilt shall fall suddenly
upon you, and you shall not know from whence it comes. What do you say? What resolution
do you make? If, after this sermon, you do not firmly resolve to give yourself to God, I weep
over you, and regard you as lost.


**SERMON XVI. SECOND SUNDAY OF LENT. - ON HEAVEN.**
**_" Lord, it is good for us to be here." MATT. xvii. 4._**


IN this days gospel we read, that wishing to give his disciples a glimpse of the glory of
Paradise, in order to animate them to labour for the divine honour, the Redeemer was
transfigured, and allowed them to behold the splendour of his countenance. Ravished with
joy and delight, St. Peter exclaimed: ” **_Lord, it is good for us to be here."_** Lord, let us remain
here; let us -.never more depart from this place; for, the sight of thy beauty consoles us more
than all the delights of the earth. Brethren, let us labour during the remainder of our lives to
gain heaven. Heaven is so great a good, that, to purchase it for us, Jesus Christ has sacrificed
his life on the cross. Be assured, that the greatest of all the torments of the damned in hell,
arise from the thought of having lost heaven through their own fault. The blessings, the
delights, the joys, the sweetness of Paradise may be acquired; but they can be described and
understood only by those blessed souls that enjoy them. But let us, with the aid of the holy
Scripture, explain the little that can be said of them here below.



1. According to the Apostle, no man on this earth, can comprehend the infinite blessings
which God has prepared for the souls that love him. ” **_Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that
love him."_** (1 Cor. ii. 9.) In this life we cannot have an idea of any other pleasures than those
which we enjoy by means of the senses. Perhaps we imagine that the beauty of heaven



resembles that of a wide extended plain covered with the verdure of spring, interspersed
with trees in full bloom, and abounding in birds fluttering about and singing on every side;
or, that it is like the beauty of a garden full of fruits and flowers, and surrounded by
fountains in continual play. ”Oh! what a Paradise," to behold such a plain, or such a garden!
But, oh! how much greater are the beauties of heaven! Speaking of Paradise, St. Bernard says:
O man, if you wish to understand the blessings of heaven, know that in that happy country
**_there is nothing which can be disagreeable, and everything that you can desire. ”Nihil est
quod nolis, totum est quod velis."_** Although there are some things here below which are
agreeable to the senses, how many more are there which only torment us? If the light of day
is pleasant, the darkness of night is disagreeable: if the spring and the autumn are cheering,
the cold of winter and the heat of summer are painful. In addition, we have to endure the
pains of sickness, the persecution of men, and the inconveniences of poverty; we must submit
to interior troubles, to fears, to temptations of the devil, doubts of conscience, and to the
uncertainty of eternal salvation.



2. But, after entering into Paradise, the blest shall have no more sorrows. ” **_God shall wipe
away all tears from their eyes."_** The Lord shall dry up the tears which they have shed in this
life. ” **_And death shall be no more, nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow, shall be any more,
for the former things are passed away. And he that sat on the throne, said: ”Behold, I make
all things new."_** (Apoc. xxi. 4, 5.) In Paradise, death and the fear of death are no more: in that
place of bliss there are no sorrows, no infirmities, no poverty, no inconveniencies, no
vicissitudes of day or night, of cold or of heat. In that kingdom there is a continual day,
always serene, a continual spring, always blooming. In Paradise there are no persecutions, no
envy; for all love each other with tenderness, and each rejoices at the happiness of the others,
as if it were his own. There is no more fear of eternal perdition; for the soul confirmed in
grace can neither sin nor lose God.


3. ” **_Totum est quod velis." In heaven you have all you can desire. ”Behold, I make all things
new."_** There everything is new; new beauties, new delights, new joys. There all our desires
shall be satisfied. The sight shall be satiated with beholding the beauty of that city. How
delightful to behold a city in which the streets should be of crystal, the houses of silver, the
windows of gold, and all adorned with the most beautiful flowers. But, oh! how much more
beautiful shall be the city of Paradise! the beauty of the place shall be heightened by the
beauty of the inhabitants, who are all clothed in royal robes; for, according to St. Augustine,
**_they are all kings. ”Quot cives, tot reges."_** How delighted to behold Mary, the queen of
heaven, who shall appear more beautiful than all the other citizens of Paradise! But, what it
must be to behold the beauty of Jesus Christ! St. Teresa once saw one of the hands of Jesus
Christ, and was struck with astonishment at the sight of such beauty. The smell shall be
satiated with odours, but with the odours of Paradise. The hearing shall be satiated with the
harmony of the celestial choirs. St. Francis once heard for a moment an angel playing on a
violin, and he almost died through joy. How delightful must it be to hear the saints and
angels singing the divine praises! **_"They shall praise thee for ever and ever."_** (Ps. lxxxiii. 5.)
What must it be to hear Mary praising God! St. Francis de Sales says, that, as the singing of
the nightingale in the wood surpasses that of all other birds, so the voice of Mary is far
superior to that of all the other saints. In a word, there are in Paradise all the delights which
man can desire.





4. But the delights of which we have spoken are the least of the blessings of Paradise. The
glory of heaven consists in seeing and loving God face to face. ”Totum quod expectamus,"
says St. Augustine, ”duæ syllabæ sunt, Deus." The reward which God promises to us does
not consist altogether in the beauty, the harmony, and other advantages of the city of
Paradise. God himself, whom the saints are allowed to behold, is, according to the promises
made to Abraham, the principal reward of the just in heaven. ” **_I am thy reward exceeding
great."_** (Gen. xv. 1.) St. Augustine asserts, that, were God to show his face to the damned,
” **_Hell would be instantly changed into a Paradise of delights."_** (Lib. de trip, habit., torn. 9.)
And he adds that, were a departed soul allowed the choice of seeing God and suffering the
pains of hell, or of being freed from these pains and deprived of the sight of God, ” **_she would
prefer to see God, and to endure these torments_** ."


5. The delights of the soul infinitely surpass all the pleasures of the senses. Even in this life
divine love infuses such sweetness into the soul when God communicates himself to her, that
the body is raised from the earth. St. Peter of Alcantara once fell into such an ecstasy of love,
that, taking hold of a tree, he drew it up from the roots, and raised it with him on high. So
great is the sweetness of divine love, that the holy martyrs, in the midst of their torments, felt
no pain, but were on the contrary filled with joy. Hence, St. Augustine says that, when St.
Lawrence was laid on a red-hot gridiron, the fervour of divine love made him insensible to
the burning heat of the fire. ” **_Hoc igne incensus non sentit incendium."_** Even on sinners who
weep for their sins, God bestows consolations which exceed all earthly pleasures. Hence St.
Bernard says: ” **_If it be so sweet to weep for thee, what must it be to rejoice in thee!"_**


6. How great is the sweetness which a soul experiences, when, in the time of prayer, God, by
a ray of his own light, shows to her his goodness and his mercies towards her, and
particularly the love which Jesus Christ has borne to her in his passion! She feels her heart
melting, and as it were dissolved through love. But in this life we do not see God as he really
is: we see him as it were in. the dark. ” **_We see now through a glass in a dark manner, but then
face to face."_** (1 Cor. xiii. 12.) Here below God is hidden from, our view; we can see him only
with the eyes of faith: how great shall be our happiness when the veil shall be raised, and we
shall be permitted to behold God face to face! We shall then see his beauty, his greatness, his
perfection, his amiableness, and his immense love for our souls.


7. ” **_Man knoweth not whether he be worthy of love or hatred."_** (Eccl. ix. 1.) The fear of not
loving God, and of not being loved by him, is the greatest affliction which souls that love
God endure on the earth; but, in heaven, the soul is certain that she loves God, and that he
loves her; she sees that the Lord embraces her with infinite love, and that this love shall not
be dissolved for all eternity. The knowledge of the love which Jesus Christ has shown her in
offering himself in sacrifice for her on the cross, and in making himself her food in the
sacrament of the altar, shall increase the ardour of her love. She shall also see clearly all the
graces which God has bestowed upon her, all the helps which he has given her, to preserve
her from falling into sin, and to draw her to his love. She shall see that all the tribulations, the
poverty, infirmities, and persecutions which she regards as misfortunes, have all proceeded
from love, and have been the means employed by Divine Providence to bring her to glory.
She shall see all the lights, loving calls, and mercies which God had granted to her, after she
had insulted him by her sins. From the blessed mountain of Paradise she shall see so many



souls damned for fewer sins than she had committed, and shall see that she herself is saved
and secured against the possibility of ever losing God.



8. The goods of this earth do not satisfy our desires: at first they gratify the senses; but when
we become accustomed to them they cease to delight. But the joys of Paradise constantly
satiate and content the heart. ” **_I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear."_** (Ps. xvi. 15.)
And though they satiate they always appear to be as new as the first time when they were
experienced; they are always enjoyed and always desired, always desired and always
possessed. ” **_Satiety,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_accompanies desire."_** (Lib. 13, Mor., c. xviii.) Thus,
the desires of the saints in Paradise do not beget pain, because they are always satisfied; and
satiety does not produce disgust, because it is always accompanied with desire. Hence the
soul shall be always satiated and always thirsty: she shall be for ever thirsty, and always
satiated with delights. The damned are, according to the Apostle, vessels full of wrath and of
torments, ” **_vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction."_** (Rom. ix. 22.) But the just are vessels full
of mercy and of joy, so that they have nothing to desire. ” **_They shall be inebriated with the
plenty of thy house."_** (Ps. xxxv. 9.) In beholding the beauty of God, the soul shall be so
inflamed and so inebriated with divine love, that she shall remain happily lost in God; for she
shall entirely forget herself, and for all eternity shall think only of loving and praising the
immense good which she shall possess for ever, without the fear of having it in her power
ever to lose it. In this life, holy souls love God; but they cannot love him with all their
strength, nor can they always actually love him. St. Thomas teaches, that this perfect love is
only given to the citizens of heaven, who love God with their whole heart, and never cease to
love him actually. ” **_Ut totum cor hominis semper actualiter in Deum feratur ista est perfectio
patriæ”_** (2, 2 quæst. 44, art. 4, ad. 2.)


9. Justly, then, has St. Augustine said, that to gain the eternal glory of Paradise, **_we should
cheerfully embrace eternal labour. ”Pro æterna requie æternus labor subeundus esset."“For
nothing_** ” says David, ” **_shalt thou save them."_** (Ps. Iv. 8.) The saints have done but little to
acquire Heaven. So many kings, who have abdicated their thrones and shut themselves up in
a cloister; so many holy anchorets, who have confined themselves in a cave; so many
martyrs, who have cheerfully submitted to torments to the rack, and to red-hot plates have
done but little. ” **_The sufferings of this life are not worthy to be compared to the glory to
come."_** (Rom. viii. 18.) To gain heaven, it would be but little to endure all the pains of this life.


10. Let us, then, brethren, courageously resolve to bear patiently with all the sufferings which
shall come upon us during the remaining days of our lives: to secure heaven they are all little
and nothing. Rejoice then; for all these pains, sorrows, and persecutions shall, if we are saved,
be to us a source of never-ending joys and delights. **_“Your sorrows shall be turned into joy."_**
(John xvi. 20.) When, then, the crosses of this life afflict us, let us raise our eyes to heaven, and
console ourselves with the hope of Paradise. At the end of her life, St. Mary of Egypt was
asked, by the Abbot St. Zozimus, how she had been able to live for forty-seven years in the
desert where he found her dying. She answered: ” **_With the hope of Paradise."_** If we be
animated with the same hope, we shall not feel the tribulations of this life. Have courage! Let
us love God and labour for heaven. There the saint expects us, Mary expects us, Jesus Christ
expects us; he holds in his hand a crown to make each of us a king in that eternal kingdom.





### SERMON XVII THIRD SUNDAY IN LENT. - ON CONCEALING SINS IN


### CONFESSION.


**_" And he was casting out a devil, and the same was dumb." LUKE xi. 14._**


THE devil does not bring sinners to hell with their eyes open: he first blinds them with the
malice of their own sins. ” **_For their own malice blinded them."_** (Wis. ii. 21.) He thus leads
them to eternal perdition. Before we fall into sin, the enemy labours to blind us, that we may
not see the evil we do and the ruin we bring upon ourselves by offending God. After we
commit sin, he seeks to make us dumb, that, through shame, we may conceal our guilt in
confession. Thus, he leads us to hell by a double chain, inducing us, after our transgressions,
to consent to a still greater sin the sin of sacrilege. I will speak on this subject today, and will
endeavour to convince you of the great evil of concealing sins in confession



1. In expounding the words of David” **_Set a door O Lord, round about my lips,"_** (Ps. cxl. 3) St.
Augustine says: **_"Non dixit claustrum, sed ostium: ostium et aperitur et clauditur: aperiatur
ad confessionem peccati: claudatur ad excusationem peccati."_** "We should keep a door to the
mouth, that it may be closed against detraction, and blasphemies, and all improper words,
and that it may be opened to confess the sins we have committed. ” **_Thus,"_** adds the holy
doctor, ” **_it will be a door of restraint, and not of destruction."_** To be silent when we are
impelled to utter words injurious to God or to our neighbour, is an act of virtue; but, to be
silent in confessing our sins, is the ruin of the soul. After we have offended God, the devil
labours to keep the mouth closed, and to prevent us from confessing our guilt. St. Antonine
relates, that a holy solitary once saw the devil standing beside a certain person who wished
to go to confession. The solitary asked the fiend what he was doing there. The enemy said in
reply: ” **_I now restore to these penitents what I before took away from them; I took away
from them shame while they were committing sin; I now restore it that they may have a
horror of confession."“My sores are putrefied and corrupted, because of my foolishness."_** (Ps.
xxxvii. 6.) Gangrenous sores are fatal; and sins concealed in confession are spiritual ulcers,
which mortify and become gangrenous.


2. **_"Pudorem,"_** says St. Chrysostom, ” **_dedit Deus peccato, confessioni nduciam: invertit rem
diabolis, peccato fiduciam præbet, confessioni pudorem."_** (Proem, in Isa.) God has made sin
shameful, that we may abstain from it, and gives us confidence to confess it by promising
pardon to all who accuse themselves of their sins. But the devil does the contrary: he gives
confidence to sin by holding out hopes of pardon; but, when sin is committed, he inspires
shame, to prevent the confession of it.


3. A disciple of Socrates, at the moment he was leaving a house of bad fame, saw his master
pass: to avoid being seen by him, he went back into the house. Socrates came to the door and
said: **_My son, it is a shameful thing to enter, but not to depart from this house. ”Non te
pudeat, fili egredi ex hoc loco, intrasse pudeat."_** To you also, brethren, who have sinned, I
say, that you ought to be ashamed to offend so great and so good a God. But you have no
reason to be ashamed of confessing the sins which you have committed. Was it shameful in
St. Mary Magdalene to acknowledge publicly at the feet of Jesus Christ that she was a sinner?
By her confession she became a saint. Was it shameful in St. Augustine not only to confess his
sins, but also to publish them in a book, that, for his confusion, they might be known to the
whole world? Was it shameful in St. Mary of Egypt to confess, that for so many years she had



led a scandalous life? By their confessions these have become saints, and are honoured on the
altars of the Church.



4. We say that the man who acknowledges his guilt before a secular tribunal is condemned ,
but in the tribunal of Jesus Christ, they who confess their sins obtain pardon, and receive a
crown of eternal glory. "After confession," says St. Chrysostom, ” **_a crown is given to
penitents."_** He who is afflicted with an ulcer must, if he wish to be cured, show it to a
physician: otherwise it will fester and bring on death. ” **_Quod ignorat,"_** says the Council of
Trent, ” **_medicina non curat."_** If, then, brethren, your souls be ulcerated with sin, be not
ashamed to confess it; otherwise you are lost. ” **_For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth."_**
(Eccl. iv. 24.) But, you say, I feel greatly ashamed to confess such a sin. If you wish to be
saved, you must conquer this shame. ” **_For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a
shame that bringeth glory and grace."_** (Ib. iv. 25.) There are, according to the inspired writer,
two kinds of shame: one of which leads souls to sin, and that is the shame which makes them
conceal their sins at confession; the other is the confusion which a Christian feels in
confessing his sins; and this confusion obtains for him the grace of God in this life, and the
glory of heaven in the next.


5. St. Augustine says, that to prevent the sheep from seeking assistance by her cries the wolf
seizes her by the neck, and thus securely carries her away and devours her. The devil acts in
a similar manner with the sheep of Jesus Christ. After having induced them to yield to sin, he
seizes them by the throat, that they may not confess their guilt; and thus he securely brings
them to hell. For those who have sinned grievously, there is no means of salvation but the
confession of their sins. But, what hope of salvation can he have who goes to confession and
conceals his sins, and makes use of the tribunal of penance to offend God, and to make
himself doubly the slave of Satan? What hope would you entertain of the recovery of the man
who, instead of taking the medicine prescribed by his physician, drank a cup of poison? God!
What can the sacrament of penance be to those who conceal their sins, but a deadly poison,
which adds to their guilt the malice of sacrilege? In giving absolution, the confessor dispenses
to his patient the blood of Jesus Christ; for it is through the merits of that blood that he
absolves from sin. What, then, does the sinner do, when he conceals his sins in confession?
He tramples under foot the blood of Jesus Christ. And should he afterwards receive the holy
communion in a state of sin, he is, according to St. Chrysostom, as guilty as if he threw the
consecrated host into a sink. ” **_Non minus detestabile est in os pollutum, quam in
sterquilinum mittere Dei Filium."_** (Hom. Ixxxiii., in Matt.) Accursed shame! how many poor
souls do you bring to hell? **_”Magis memores pudoris,"_** says Tertullian, ” **_quam salutis."_**
Unhappy souls! they think only of the shame of confessing their sins, and do not reflect that,
if they conceal them, they shall be certainly damned.


6. Some penitents ask: ” **_What will my confessor say when he hears that I have committed
such a sin ?"_** What will he say? He will say that you are, like all persons living on this earth,
miserable and prone to sin: he will say that, if you have done evil, you have also performed a
glorious action in overcoming shame, and in candidly confessing your fault.


7. ” **_But I am afraid to confess this sin."_** To how many confessors, I ask, must you tell it? It is
enough to mention it to one priest, who hears many sins of the same kind from others. It is
enough to confess it once: the confessor will give you penance and absolution, and your



conscience shall be tranquillized. But, you say: ” **_I feel a great repugnance to tell this sin to my
spiritual father."_** Tell it, then, to another confessor, and, if you wish, to one to whom you are
unknown. ”But, if this come to the knowledge of my confessor, he will be displeased with
me." What then do you mean to do? Perhaps, to avoid giving displeasure to him, you intend
to commit a heinous crime, and remain under sentence of damnation. This would be the very
height of folly.



8. Are you afraid that the confessor will make known your sin to others? Would it not be
madness to suspect that he is so wicked as to break the seal of confession by revealing your
sin to others? Remember that the obligation of the seal of confession is so strict, that a
confessor cannot speak out of confession, even to the penitent, of the smallest venial fault;
and if he did so, * he would be guilty of a most grievous sin.


9. But you say: "I am afraid that my confessor, when he hears my sin, will rebuke me with
great severity." God! Do you not see that all these are deceitful artifices of the devil to bring
you to hell? No; the confessor will not rebuke you, but he will give an advice suited to your
state. A confessor cannot experience greater consolation than in absolving a penitent who
confesses his sins with true sorrow and with sincerity. If a queen were mortally wounded by
a slave, and you were in possession of a remedy by which she could be cured, how great
would be your joy in saving her life! Such is the joy which a confessor feels in absolving a
soul in the state of sin. By his act he delivers her from eternal death: and by restoring to her
the grace of God, he makes her a queen of Paradise.
**_* That is, without the permission of the penitent._**


10. But you have so many fears, and are not afraid of damning your own soul by the
enormous crime of concealing sins in confession. You are afraid of the rebuke of your
confessor, and fear not the reproof which you shall receive from Jesus Christ, your Judge, at
the hour of death. You are afraid that your sins shall become known (which is impossible),
and you dread not the day of judgment, on which, if you conceal them, they shall be revealed
to all men. If you knew that, by concealing sins in confession, they shall be made known to all
your relatives and to all your neighbours, you would certainly confess them. **_But, do you not
know,_** says St. Bernard, **_that if you refuse to confess your sins to one man, who, like yourself,
is a sinner, they shall be made known not only to all your relatives and neighbours, but to
the entire human race?”Si pudor est tibi uni homini, et peccatori peccatum exponere, quid
facturus es in die judicii, ubi omnibus exposita tua conscientia patebit ?"_** (S. Ber. super illud
Joan., cap. xi.)” **_Lazare veni foras."_** If you do not confess your sin, God himself shall, for your
confusion, publish not only the sin which you conceal, but also all your iniquities, in the
presence of the angels and of the whole world. ” **_I will discover thy shame to thy face, and
will show thy wickedness to the nations."_** (Nah. iii. 5.)


11. Listen, then, to the advice of St. Ambrose. The devil keeps an account of your sins, to
charge you with them at the tribunal of Jesus Christ. Do you wish, says the saint, to prevent
this accusation? **_Anticipate your accuser: accuse yourself now to a confessor, and then no
accuser shall appear against you at the judgment-seat of God. ”Præveni accusatorem tuum;
si to accusaveris, accusatorem nullum timebis."_** (Lib. 2 de Pœnit., cap. ii.) But, according to
St. Augustine, **_if you excuse yourself in confession, you shut up sin within your soul, and
shut out pardon. “Excusas te, includis peccatum, excludis indulgentiam."_** (Hom. xii. 50.)



### 


12. If, then, brethren, there be a single soul among you who has ever concealed a sin, through
shame, in the tribunal of penance, let him take courage, and make a full confession of all his
faults. ” **_Give glory to God with a good heart."_** (Eccl. xxxv. 10.) Give glory to God, and
confusion to the devil. A certain penitent was tempted by Satan to conceal a sin through
shame; but she was resolved to confess it; and while she was going to her confessor, the devil
came forward and asked her where she was going. She courageously answered: **_"I am going
to cover myself and you with confusion."_** Act you in a similar manner; if you have ever
concealed a mortal sin, confess it candidly to your director, and confound the devil.
Remember that the greater the violence you do yourself in confessing your sins, the greater
will be the love with which Jesus Christ will embrace you.


13. Courage, then! expel this viper which you harbour in your soul, and which continually
corrodes your heart and destroys your peace. Oh! what a hell does a Christian suffer who
keeps in his heart a sin concealed through shame in confession! He suffers an anticipation of
hell. It is enough to say to the confessor: ” **_Father, I have a certain scruple regarding my past
life, but I am ashamed to tell it."_** This will be enough: the confessor will help to pluck out the
serpent which gnaws your conscience. And, that you may not entertain groundless scruples,
I think it right to tell you, that if the sin which you are ashamed to tell be not mortal, or if you
never considered it to be a mortal sin, you are not obliged to confess it; for we are bound only
to confess mortal sins. Moreover, if you have doubts whether you ever confessed a certain sin
of your former life, but know that, in preparing for confession, you always carefully
examined your conscience, and that you never concealed a sin through shame; in this case,
even though the sin about the confession of which you are doubtful, had been a grievous
fault, you are not obliged to confess it because it is presumed to be morally certain that you
have already confessed it. But, if you know that the sin was grievous, and that you never
accused yourself of it in confession, then there is no remedy; you must confess it, or you must
be damned for it. But, lost sheep, go instantly to confession. Jesus Christ is waiting for you;
he stands with arms open to pardon and embrace you, if you acknowledge your guilt. I
assure you that, after having confessed all your sins, you shall feel such consolation at having
unburdened your conscience and acquired the grace of God, that you shall for ever bless the
day on which you made this confession. Go as soon as possible in search of a confessor. Do
not give the devil time to continue to tempt you. and to make you put off your confession: go
immediately: for Jesus Christ is waiting for you.


**SERMON XVIII. FOURTH SUNDAY OF LENT. - ON THE TENDER COMPASSION
WHICH JESUS CHRIST ENTERTAINS TOWARDS SINNERS.**
**_"Make the men sit down." JOHN vi. 10._**


WE read in this day’s gospel that, having gone up into a mountain with his disciples, and
seeing a multitude of five thousand persons, who followed him because they saw the
miracles which he wrought on them that were diseased, the Redeemer said to St. Philip:
**_"Whence shall we huy bread, that these may eat ?" “Lord," answered St. Philip, ”two-
hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient that every one may take a little." St. Andrew
then said: There is a boy here that has five barley loaves and two fishes; but what are these
among so many? But Jesus Christ said: ”Make the men sit down." And he distributed the
loaves and fishes among them. The multitude were satisfied: and the fragments of bread_**



**_which remained filled twelve baskets. ”_** The Lord wrought this miracle through compassion
for the bodily wants of these poor people; but far more tender is his compassion for the
necessities of the souls of the poor that is, of sinners who are deprived of the divine grace.
This tender compassion of Jesus Christ for sinners shall be the subject of this day’s discourse.



1. Through the bowels of his mercy towards men, who groaned under the slavery of sin and
Satan, our most loving Redeemer descended from heaven to earth, to redeem and save them
from eternal torments by his own death. Such was the language of St. Zachary, the father of
the Baptist, when the Blessed Virgin, who had already become the mother of the Eternal
Word, entered his house. ” **_Through the bowels of the mercy of our God, in which the Orient
from on high hath visited us."_** (Luke i. 78.)


2. Jesus Christ, the good pastor, who came into the world to obtain salvation for us his sheep,
has said: ” **_I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly."_** (John x.
10.) Mark the expression, **_"more abundantly”_** which signifies that the Son of Man came on
earth not only to restore us to the life of grace which we lost, but to give us a better life than
that which we forfeited by sin. Yes; for as St. Leo says, the benefits which we have derived
from the death of Jesus are greater than the injury which the devil has done us by sin.
” **_Ampliora adepti sumus per Christ! gratiam quam per diaboli amiseramus invidiam."_** (Ser.
i., de Ascen.) The same doctrine is taught by the Apostle, who says that, **_“where sin
abounded, grace did more abound."_** (Rom. v. 20.)


3. But, my Lord, since thou hast resolved to take human flesh, would not a single prayer
offered by thee be sufficient for the redemption of all men? What need, then, was there of
leading a life of poverty, humiliation, and contempt, for thirty- three years, of suffering a
cruel and shameful death on an infamous gibbet, and of shedding all thy blood by dint of
torments? I know well, answers Jesus Christ, that one drop of my blood, or a simple prayer,
would be sufficient for the salvation of the world; but neither would be sufficient to show the
love which I bear to men: and therefore, to be loved by men when they should see me dead
on the cross for the love of them, I have resolved to submit to so many torments and to so
painful a death. This, he says, is the duty of a good pastor. ” **_I am the good shepherd. The good
shepherd giveth his life for his sheep... I lay down my life for my sheep."_** (John x. 11, 15.)


4. O men, O men, what greater proof of love could the Son of God give us than to lay down
his life for us his sheep?” **_In this we have known the charity of God; because he hath laid
down his life for us."_** (I John iii. 16.) No one, says the Saviour, can show greater love to his
friends than to give his life for them. **_“Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay
down his life for his friends."_** (John xv. 13.) But thou, O Lord, hast died not only for friends,
but for us who were thy enemies by sin. “When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
by the death of his Son." (Rom. v. 10.) infinite love of our God, exclaims St. Bernard;” **_to spare
slaves, neither the Father has spared the Son, nor the Son himself."_** To pardon us, who were
rebellious servants, the Father would not pardon the Son, and the Son would not pardon
himself, but, by his death, has satisfied the divine justice for the sins which we have
committed.


5. When Jesus Christ was near his passion he went one day to Samaria: the Samaritans
refused to receive him. Indignant at the insult offered by the Samaritans to their Master, St.



James and St. John, turning to Jesus, said: ” **_Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come
down from heaven and consume them ?"_** (Luke ix. 54.) But Jesus, who was all sweetness, even
to those who insulted him, answered: ” **_You know not of what spirit you are. The Son of Man
came not to destroy souls, but to save."_** (r. 55 and 50.) He severely rebuked the disciples.
What spirit is this, he said, which possesses you? It is not my spirit: mine is the spirit of
patience and compassion; for I am come, not to destroy, but to save the souls of men: and you
speak of fire, of punishment, and of vengeance. Hence, in another place, he said to his
disciples: **_"Learn of me, because I am meek and humble of heart."_** (Matt. xi. 29 ) I do not wish
of you to learn of me to chastise, but to be meek, and to bear and pardon injuries.


6. How beautiful has he described the tenderness of his heart towards sinners in the
following words: ” **_What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and, if he lose one of them,
doth he not leave ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which is lost until he find it:
and when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulder rejoicing; and coming home, call together
his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep
that was lost ?"_** (Luke xv. 4, 5, and 6.) But, Lord, it is not thou that oughtest to rejoice, but the
sheep that has found her pastor and her God. The sheep indeed, answers Jesus, rejoices at
finding me, her shepherd; but far greater is the joy which 1 feel at having found one of my
lost sheep. He concludes the parable in these words: ” **_I say to you, that even so there shall be
joy in heaven, for one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just, who need
not penance."_** (Luke xv. 7.) There is more joy in heaven at the conversion of one sinner, than
upon ninety-nine just men who preserve their innocence. What sinner, then, can be so
hardened as not to go instantly and cast himself at the feet of his Saviour, when he knows the
tender love with which Jesus Christ is prepared to embrace him, and carry him on his
shoulders, as soon as he repents of his sins?



7. The Lord has also declared his tenderness towards penitent sinners in the parable of the
Prodigal Child. (Luke xv. 12, etc.) In that parable the Son of God says, that a certain young
man, unwilling to be any longer under the control of his father, and desiring to live according
to his caprice and corrupt inclinations, asked the portion of his fathers substance which fell to
him. The father gave it with sorrow, weeping over the ruin of his son. The son departed from
his father’s house. Having in a short time dissipated his substance, he was reduced to such a
degree of misery that, to procure the necessaries of life, he was obliged to feed swine. All this
was a figure of a sinner, who, after departing from God, and losing the divine grace and all
the merits he had acquired, leads a life of misery under the slavery of the devil. In the gospel
it is added that the young man, seeing his wretched condition, resolved to return to his
father: and the father, who is a figure of Jesus Christ, seeing his son return to him, was
instantly moved to pity. **_"His father saw him, and was moved with compassion"_** (v. 20); and,
instead of driving him away, as the ungrateful son had deserved, **_"running to him, he fell
upon his neck and kissed him."_** He ran with open arms to meet him, and, through tenderness,
fell upon his neck, and consoled him by his embraces. He then said to his servants: ” **_Bring
forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him."_** According to St. Jerome and St. Augustine,
the first robe signifies the divine grace, which, in addition to new celestial gifts, God, by
granting pardon, gives to the penitent sinner. **_"And put a ring on his finger."_** Give him the
ring of- a spouse. By recovering the grace of God, the soul becomes again the spouse of Jesus
Christ. **_“And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry"_** (v. 23).
Bring hither the fatted calf which signifies the holy communion, or Jesus in the holy



sacrament mystically killed and offered in sacrifice on the altar; let us eat and rejoice. But
why, divine Father, so much joy at the return of so ungrateful a child? **_Because, answered the
Father, this my son was dead, and he is come to life again; he was lost, and I have found him._**



8. This tenderness of Jesus Christ was experienced by the sinful woman (according to St.
Gregory, Mary Magdalene) who cast herself at the feet of Jesus, and **_washed them with her
tears._** (Luke vii. 47 and 50.) The Lord, turning to her with sweetness, consoled her by saying:
**_"Thy sins are forgiven ;... thy faith hath made thee safe; go in peace."_** (Luke vii. 48 and 50.)
Child, thy sins are pardoned; thy confidence in me has saved thee; go in peace. It was also felt
by the man who was sick for thirty- eight years, and who was infirm, both in body and soul.
The Lord cured his malady, and pardoned his sins. **_"Behold,"_** says Jesus to him, ” **_thou art
made whole; sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee."_** (John v. 14.) The tenderness
of the Redeemer was also felt by the leper who said to Jesus Christ: ” **_Lord, if thou wilt, thou
canst make me clean."_** (Matt. viii. 2.) Jesus answered: **_"I will: be thou made clean"_** (v. 3). As if
he said: Yes; I will that thou be made clean; for I have come down from heaven for the
purpose of consoling all: be healed, then, according to thy desire. ” **_And forthwith his leprosy
was cleansed."_**


9. We have also a proof of the tender compassion of the Son of God for sinners, in his conduct
towards the woman caught in adultery. The scribes and pharisees brought her before him,
and said: ”This woman was even now taken in adultery. Now Moses, in the law, commands
us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou ?" (John viii. 4 and 5.) And this they did, as St.
John says, tempting him. They intended to accuse him of transgressing the law of Moses, **_if he
said that she ought to be liberated; and they expected to destroy his character for meekness,
if he said that she should be stoned. “Si dicat lapidandam,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_famam
perdet mansuetudinis; sin dimmitteudam, transgressæ legis accusabitur."_** (Tract, xxxiii. in
Joan.)But what was the answer of our Lord? He neither said that she should be stoned nor
dismissed; but, ” **_bowing himself down, he wrote with his finger on the ground."_** The
interpreters say that, probably, what he wrote on the ground was a text of Scripture
admonishing the accusers of their own sins, which were, perhaps, greater than that of the
woman charged with adultery. ” **_He then lifted himself up, and said to them: He that is
without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her”_** (v. 7). The scribes and pharisees
went away one by one, and the woman stood alone. Jesus Christ, turning to her, said: **_"Hath
no one condemned thee? neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more"_** (v. 11). Since
no one has condemned you, fear not that you shall be condemned by me, who hath come on
earth, not to condemn, but to pardon and save sinners: go in peace, and sin no more.


10. Jesus Christ has come, not to condemn, but to deliver sinners from hell, as soon as they
resolve to amend their lives. And when he sees them obstinately bent on their own perdition,
he addresses them with tears in the words of Ezechiel **_: ”Why will you die, O house of
Israel?"_** (xviii. 31). My children, why will you die? Why do you voluntarily rush into hell,
when I have come from heaven to deliver you from it by death? He adds: you are already
dead to the grace of God. But I will not your death: return to me, and I will restore to you the
life which you have lost. "For I desire not the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God:
return ye and live" (v. 32). But some sinners, who are immersed in the abyss of sin, may say:
Perhaps, if we return to Jesus Christ, he will drive us away. No; for the Redeemer has said:
” **_And him that cometh to me I will not cast out."_** (John vi. 37.) No one that comes to me with



sorrow for his past sins, however manifold and enormous they may have been, shall be
rejected.



11. Behold how, in another place, the Redeemer encourages us to throw ourselves at his feet
with a secure hope of consolation and pardon. ” **_Come to me, all you that labour and are
burdened, and I will refresh you."_** (Matt. xi. 28.) Come to me, all ye poor sinners, who labour
for your own damnation, and groan under the weight of your crimes; come, and I will deliver
you from all your troubles. Again, he says, ” **_Come and accuse me, saith the Lord; if your sins
be as scarlet, they shall be made white as snow; and if they be red as crimson, they shall be
made white as wool."_** (Isa. i. 18.) Come with sorrow for the offences you committed against
me, and if I do not give you pardon, accuse me. As if he said: upbraid me; rebuke me as a
liar; for I promise that, though your sins were of scarlet that is, of the most horrid enormity
your soul, by my blood, in which I shall wash it, will become white and beautiful as snow.


12. Let us then, sinners, return instantly to Jesus Christ. If we have left him, let us
immediately return, before death overtakes us in sin and sends us to hell, where the mercies
and graces of the Lord shall, if we do not amend, be so many swords which shall lacerate the
heart for all eternity.


**SERMON XIX. PASSION SUNDAY. - ON THE DANGER TO WHICH TEPIDITY
EXPOSES THE SOUL.**
**_"But Jesus hid himself." JOHN viii. 59._**


JESUS CHRIST **_"is the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world.
”_** (John i. 9.) He enlightens all; but he cannot enlighten those who voluntarily shut their eyes
to the light; from them the Saviour hides himself. How then can they, walking in darkness,
escape the many dangers of perdition to which we are exposed in this life, which God has
given us as the road to eternal happiness? I will endeavour Today to convince you of the
great danger into which tepidity brings the soul, since it makes Jesus Christ hide his divine
light from her, and makes him less liberal in bestowing upon her the graces and helps,
without which she shall find it very difficult to complete the journey of this life without
falling into an abyss that is, into mortal sin.


1. A tepid soul is not one that lives in enmity with God, nor one that sometimes commits
venial sins through mere frailty, and not with full deliberation. On account of the corruption
of nature by original sin, no man can be exempt from such venial faults. This corruption of
nature renders it impossible for us, without a most special grace, which has been given only
to the mother of God, to avoid all venial sins during our whole lives. Hence St. John has said:
**_"If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."_** (1 John i. 8.)
God permits defects of this kind, even in the saints, to keep them humble, and to make them
feel that, as they commit such faults in spite of all their good purposes and promises, so also,
were they not supported by his divine hand, they would fall into mortal sins. Hence, when
we find that we have committed these light faults, we must humble ourselves, and
acknowledging our own weakness, we must be careful to recommend ourselves to God, and
implore of him to preserve us, by his almighty hand, from more grievous transgressions, and
to deliver us from those we have committed.





2. What then are we to understand by a tepid soul? A tepid soul is one that frequently falls
into fully deliberate venial sins such as deliberate lies, deliberate acts of impatience,
deliberate imprecations, and the like. These faults may be easily avoided by those who are
resolved to suffer death rather than commit a deliberate venial offence against God. St.
Teresa used to say, that one venial sin does us more harm than all the devils in hell. Hence
she would say to her nuns: **_"My children, from deliberate sin, however venial it may be, may
the Lord deliver you."_** Some complain of being left in aridity and dryness, and without any
spiritual sweetness. But how can we expect that God will be liberal of his favours to us, when
we are ungenerous to him? We know that such a lie, such an imprecation, such an injury to
our neighbour, and such detraction, though not mortal sins, are displeasing to God, and still
we do not abstain from them. Why then should we expect that God will give us his divine
consolations?


3. But some of you will say: Venial sins, however great they may be, do not deprive the soul
of the grace of God: even though I commit them I will he saved; and for me it is enough to
obtain eternal life. You say that, ” **_for you it is enough to be saved."_** Remember that St.
Augustine says that, ” **_where you have said, „ It is enough‟ there you have perished."_** To
understand correctly the meaning of these words of St. Augustine, and to see the danger to
which the state of tepidity exposes those who commit habitual and deliberate venial sins,
without feeling remorse for them, and without endeavouring to avoid them, it is necessary to
know that the habit of light faults leads the soul insensibly to mortal sins. For example: the
habit of venial acts of aversion leads to mortal hatred; the habit of small thefts leads to
grievous rapine; the habit of venial attachments leads to affections which are mortally sinful.
” **_The soul,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_never lies where it falls."_** (Moral., lib. xxxi.) No; it continues to
sink still deeper. Mortal diseases do not generally proceed from serious indisposition, but
from many slight and continued infirmities; so, likewise, the fall of many souls into mortal
sin follows from habitual venial sins; for these render the soul so weak that, when a strong
temptation assails her, she has not strength to resist it, and she falls.


4. Many are unwilling to be separated from God by mortal sins; they wish to follow him, but
at a distance, and regardless of venial sins. But to them shall probably happen what befell St.
Peter. When Jesus Christ was seized in the garden, St. Peter was unwilling to abandon the
Lord, but **_"followed him afar off."_** (Matt. xxvi. 58.) After entering the house of Caiphas, he
was charged with being a disciple of Jesus Christ. He was instantly seized with fear, and
three times denied his Master. The Holy Ghost says: ” **_He that contemneth small things shall
fall by little and little."_** (Eccl. xix. 1.) They who despise small falls will probably one day fall
into an abyss; for, being in the habit of committing light offences against God, they will feel
but little repugnance to offer to him some grievous insult.


5. The Lord says: ” **_Catch us the little foxes that destroy the vines."_** (Cant. ii. 15.) He does not
tell us to catch the lions or the bears, but the little foxes. Lions and bears strike terror, and
therefore all are careful to keep at a distance through fear of being devoured by them; but the
little foxes, though they do not excite dismay, destroy the vine by drying up its roots. Mortal
sin terrifies the timorous soul; but, if she accustom herself to the commission of many venial
sins with full deliberation, and without endeavouring to correct them, they, like the little
foxes, shall destroy the roots that is, the remorse of conscience, the fear of offending God, and



the holy desires of advancing in divine love; and thus, being in a state of tepidity, and
impelled to sin by some passion, the soul will easily abandon God and lose the divine grace.



6. Moreover, deliberate and habitual venial sins not only deprive us of strength to resist
temptations, but also of the special helps without which we fall into grievous sins. Be
attentive, brethren; for this is a point of great importance. It is certain, that of ourselves we
have not sufficient strength to resist the temptations of the devil, of the flesh, and of the
world. It is God that prevents our enemies from assailing us with temptations by which we
would be conquered. Hence Jesus Christ has taught us the following prayer: ” **_And lead us
not into temptation."_** He teaches us to pray that God may deliver us from the temptations to
which we would yield, and thus lose his grace. Wow, venial sins, when they are deliberate
and habitual, deprive us of the special helps of God which are necessary for preservation in
his grace. I say necessary, because the Council of Trent anathematizes those who assert that
we can persevere in grace without a special help from God. ” **_Si quis dixerit, justificatum vel
sine speciali auxilio Dei in accepta justitia perseverare posse, vel cum eo non posse;
anathema sit."_** (Sess. 6, can. xxii.) Thus, with the ordinary assistance of God, we cannot avoid
falling into some mortal sin: a special aid is necessary. But this special aid God will justly
withhold from tepid souls who are regardless of committing, with full deliberation, many
venial sins. Thus these unhappy souls shall not persevere in grace.


7. They who are ungenerous to God well deserve that God should not be liberal to them. **_"He
who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly."_** (2 Cor. ix. 6.) To such souls the Lord will
give the graces common to all, but will probably withhold his special assistance; and without
this, as we have seen, they cannot persevere without falling into mortal sin. God himself
revealed to B. Henry Suso, that, for tepid souls who are content with leading a life exempt
from mortal sin, and continue to commit many deliberate venial sins, it is very difficult to
preserve themselves in the state of grace. The venerable Lewis da Ponte used to say: **_"I
commit many defects, but I never make peace with them."_** Woe to him who is at peace with
his faults! St. Bernard teaches that, as long as a person who is guilty of defects detests his
faults, there is reason to hope that he will one day correct them and amend his life: but when
he commits faults without endeavouring to amend, he will continually go from bad to worse,
till he loses the grace of God. St. Augustine says that, like a certain disease of the skin which
makes the body an object of disgust, habitual faults, when committed without any effort of
amendment, render the soul so disgusting to God, that he deprives her of his embraces.
” **_Sunt velut scabies, et nostrum decus ita exterminant ut a sponsi amplcxibus separent."_**
(Hom. 1., cap. iii.) Hence the soul, finding no more nourishment and consolation in her
devout exercises, in her prayers, communions, or visits to the blessed sacrament, will soon
neglect them, and thus neglecting the means of eternal salvation, she shall be in great danger
of being lost.


8. This danger will be still greater for those who commit many venial sins through
attachment to any passion, such as pride, ambition, aversion to a neighbour, or an inordinate
affection for any person. **_1st. Francis of Assisium says that, in endeavouring to draw to sin a
soul that is afraid of being in enmity with God, the devil does not seek in the beginning to
bind her with the chain of a slave, by tempting her to commit mortal sin, Because she would
have a horror of yielding to mortal sin, and would guard herself against it. He first
endeavours to bind her by a single hair; then by a slender thread; next by a cord; afterwards_**



**_by a rope; and in the end by a chain of hell that is, by mortal sin; and thus he makes her his
slave._** For example: A person cherishes an affection for a female through a motive of courtesy
or of gratitude, or from an esteem for her good qualities. This affection is followed by mutual
presents; to these succeed words of tenderness; and after the first violent assault of the devil,
the miserable man shall find that he has fallen into mortal sin. He meets with the fate of
gamesters, who, after frequently losing large sums of money, yield to an impulse of passion,
risk their all, and, in the end, lose their entire property.



9. Miserable the soul that allows herself to be the slave of any passion. **_“Behold, how small a
fire what a great wood it kindleth."_** (St. James iii. 5.) A small spark, if it be not extinguished,
will set fire to an entire wood; that is, an unmodified passion shall bring the soul to ruin.
Passion blinds us; and the blind often fall into an abyss when they least expect it. According
to St. Ambrose, the devil is constantly endeavouring to find out the passion which rules in
our heart, and the pleasures which have the greatest attraction for us. When he discovers
them, he presents occasions of indulging them: he then excites concupiscence, and prepares a
chain to make us the slaves of hell. ” **_Tune maxime insidiatur adversarius quando videt in
nobis passiones aliquas generari: tune fomites movet, laqueos parat."_**


10. St. Chrysostom asserts, that he himself knew many persons who were gifted with great
virtues, and who, because they disregarded light faults, fell into an abyss of crime. When the
devil cannot gain much from us, he is in the beginning content with the little; by many
trifling victories he will make a great conquest. No one, says St. Bernard, suddenly falls from
the state of grace into the abyss of wickedness. **_They who rush into the most grievous
irregularities, begin by committing light faults. "Nemo repente fit turpissimus: a minimis
incipiunt qui in maxima proruunt."_** (Tract de Ord. vita3.) It is necessary also to understand
that, when a soul that has been favoured by God with special lights and graces, consents to
mortal sin, her fall shall not be a simple fall, from which she will easily rise again, but it will
be a precipitous one, from which she will find it very difficult to return to God.


11. Addressing a person in the state of tepidity, our Lord said: ” **_I would that thou wert cold
or hot; but because thou art luke-warm, and neither hot nor cold, I will begin to vomit thee
out of my mouth."_** (Apoc. iii. 15, 16.)”I would thou wert cold" that is, it would be better for
thee to be deprived of my grace, because there should then be greater hopes of thy
amendment; but, because thou livest in tepidity, without any desire of improvement, ”I will
begin to vomit thee out of my mouth." By these words he means, that he will begin to
abandon the soul; for, what is vomited, is taken back only with great horror.


12. A certain author says, that tepidity is a hectic fever, which does not excite alarm, because
it is not perceived; but it is, at the same time, so malignant that it is rarely cured. The
comparison is very just; for tepidity makes the soul insensible to remorses of conscience; and,
as she is accustomed to feel no remorse for venial faults, she will by degrees become
insensible to the stings of remorse which arise from mortal sins.


13. Let us come to the remedy. The amendment of a tepid soul is difficult; but there are
remedies for those who wish to adopt them. First, the tepid must sincerely desire to be
delivered from a state which, as we have seen, is so miserable and dangerous; for, without
this desire, they shall not take pains to employ the proper means. Secondly, they must



resolve to remove the occasions of their faults; otherwise they will always relapse into the
same defects. Thirdly, they must earnestly beg of the Lord to raise them from so wretched a
state. By their own strength they can do nothing; but they can do all things with the
assistance of God, who has promised to hear the prayers of all. **_“Ask, and it shall be given;
seek, and you shall find."_** (Luke xi. 9.) We must pray, and continue to pray without
interruption. If we cease to pray we shall be defeated; but if we persevere in prayer we shall
conquer.


**SERMON XX. PALM SUNDAY. - ON THE EVIL EFFECTS OF BAD HABITS.**


**_Go ye into the village that is over against you, and immediately you shall find an ass tied."
MATT. xxi. 2._**


WISHING to enter Jerusalem, to be there acknowledged as the promised Messiah sent by
God for the salvation of the world, the Saviour said to his disciples: **_“Go to a certain village,
and you will find an ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them, and bring them to me." “The
ass which was tied,"_** says St. Bonaventure, **_"denotes a sinner."_** This exposition is conformable
to the doctrine of the Wise Man, who says, that the wicked are bound by the chains of their
own sins. **_"His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the rope of his
own sins."_** (Prov. v. 22.) But, as Jesus Christ could not sit on the ass before she was loosed, so
he cannot dwell in a soul bound with her own iniquities. If, then, brethren, there be among
you a soul bound by any bad habit, let her attend to the admonition which the Lord
addresses to her this morning. ”Loose the bond from off thy neck, captive daughter of Sion."
(Isa. Hi. 2.) Loose the bonds of your sins, which make you the slave of Satan. Loose the bonds
before the habit of sin gains such power over you, as to render your conversion morally
impossible, and thus to bring you to eternal perdition. This morning I will show, in three
points, the evil effects of bad habits.
**_First Point. A bad habit blinds the understanding.
Second Point. It hardens the heart.
Third Point. It diminishes our strength._**


**_First Point. A bad habit blinds the understanding._**



1. Of those who live in the habit of sin, St. Augustine says: ” **_Ipsa consuetudo non sinit videre
malum, quod faciunt."_** The habit of sin blinds sinners, so that they no longer see the evil
which they do, nor the ruin which they "bring upon themselves; hence they live in blindness,
as if there was neither God, nor heaven, nor hell, nor eternity. ” **_Sins,"_** adds the saint,
” **_however enormous, when habitual, appear to be small, or not to be sins at all."_** How then
can the soul guard against them, when she is no longer sensible of their deformity, or the evil
which they bring upon her?


2. St. Jerome says, that habitual sinners **_“are not even ashamed of their crimes."_** Bad actions
naturally produce a certain shame; but this feeling is destroyed by the habit of sin. St. Peter
compares habitual sinners to swine wallowing in mire. ” **_The sow that was washed is
returned to her wallowing in the mire."_** (2 Pet. ii. "22.) The very mire of sin blinds them; and,
therefore, instead of feeling sorrow and shame at their uncleanness, they revel and exult in it.
” **_A fool worketh mischief as it were for sport."_** (Prov. x. 23.)” **_Who are glad when they have_**



**_done evil."_** (Prov. ii. 14.) Hence the saints continually seek light from God; for they know
that, should he withdraw his light, they may become the greatest of sinners. How, then, do so
many Christians, who know by faith that there is a hell, and a just God, who cannot but
chastise the wicked, how, I say, do they continue to live in sin till death, and thus bring
themselves to perdition? **_”Their own malice blinded them."_** (Wis. ii, 21.) Sin blinds them, and
thus they are lost.



3. Job says, that habitual sinners are full of iniquities. **_"His bones shall be filled with the vices
of his youth."_** (xx. 11.) Every sin produces darkness in the understanding. Hence, the more
sins are multiplied by a bad habit, the greater the blindness they cause. The light of the sun
cannot enter a vessel filled with clay; and a heart full of vices cannot admit the light of God,
which would make visible to the soul the abyss into which she is running. Bereft of light, the
habitual sinner goes on from sin to sin, without ever thinking of repentance. **_“The wicked
walk round about,"_** (Ps. xi. 9.) Fallen into the dark pit of evil habits, he thinks only of sinning,
he speaks only of sins, and no longer sees the evil of sin. In fine, he becomes like a brute
devoid of reason, and seeks and desires only what pleases the senses. ” **_And man, when he
was in honour, did not understand: he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to
them. ”_** (Ps. xlviii. 13.) Hence the words of the Wise Man are fulfilled with regard to habitual
sinners. **_“The wicked man when he comes into the depth of sin, contemneth."_** (Prov. xviii. 3.)
This passage St. Chrysostom applies to habitual sinners, who, shut up in a pit of darkness,
despise sermons, calls of God, admonitions, censures, hell, and God, and become like the
vulture that waits to be killed by the fowler, rather than abandon the corrupt carcass on
which it feeds.


4. Brethren, let us tremble, as David did when he said: ” **_Let not the tempests of water drown
me, nor the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me."_** (Ps. Ixviii. 16.)
Should a person fall into a pit, there is hope of deliverance as long as the mouth of the pit is
not closed; but as soon as it is shut, he is lost. When a sinner falls into a bad habit, the mouth
of the pit is gradually closed as his sins are multiplied; the moment the mouth of the pit is
shut, he is abandoned by God. Dearly beloved sinners, if you have contracted a habit of any
sin, endeavour instantly to go out of that pit of hell, before God shall deprive you entirely of
his light, and abandon you; for, as soon as he abandons you by the total withdrawal of his
light, all is over, and you are lost.


**_Second Point. A bad habit hardens the heart._**


5. The habit of sin not only blinds the understanding, but also hardens the heart of the sinner.
**_“His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith‟s anvil."_** (Job xli. 15.) By the
habit of sin the heart becomes like a stone; and, as the anvil is hardened by repeated strokes
of the hammer, so, instead of being softened by divine inspirations or by instructions, the
soul of the habitual sinner is rendered more obdurate by sermons on the judgment of God, on
the torments of the damned, and on the passion of Jesus Christ: **_"his heart shall be firm as a
smith‟s anvil." "Their heart_** ," says St. Augustine, **_"is hardened against the dew of grace, so as
to produce no fruit."_** Divine calls, remorses of conscience, terrors of Divine justice, are
showers of divine grace; but when, instead of drawing fruit from these divine blessings, the
habitual sinner continues to commit sin, he hardens his heart, and thus, according to St.
Thomas of Villanova, he gives a sign of his certain damnation **_"Induratio damnationis_**



**_indicium;"_** for, from the loss of God’s light, and the hardness of his heart, the sinner will,
according to the terrible threat of the Holy Ghost, remain obstinate till death. ” **_A hard heart
shall fare evil at the end."_** (Eccl. iii. 27.)



6. Of what use are confessions, when, in a short time after them, the sinner returns to the
same vices? **_“He who strikes his breast,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_and does not amend, confirms,
but does not take away sins."_** When you strike your breast in the tribunal of penance, but do
not amend and remove the occasions of sin, you then, according to the saint, do not take
away your sins, but you make them more firm and permanent; that is, you render yourself
more obstinate in sin. “The wicked walk round about." (Ps. xi. 9.) Such is the unhappy life of
habitual sinners. They go round about from sin to sin; and if they abstain for a little, they
immediately, at the first occasion of temptation, return to their former iniquities. St. Bernard
regards as certain the damnation of such sinners: **_"Væ homini, qui sequitur hunc circuitum."_**
(Serm. xii. sup. Psalmos.)


7. But some young persons may say: I will hereafter amend, and sincerely give myself to
God. But, if a habit of sin takes possession of you, when will you amend? The Holy Ghost
declares, that a young man who contracts an evil habit will not relinquish it even in his old
age. “ **_A young man, according to his way, even when he is old, he will not depart from it. ”_**
(Prov. xxii. 6 .) Habitual sinners have been known to yield, even at the hour of death, to the
sins which they have been in the habit of committing. Father Recupito relates, that a person
condemned to death, even while he was going to the place of execution, raised his eyes, saw
a young female, and consented to a bad thought. We read in a work of Father Gisolfo, that a
certain blasphemer, who had been likewise condemned to death, when thrown off the
scaffold, broke out into a blasphemy, and died in that miserable state.


8. ” **_He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth."_** (Rom. ix. 18.) God
shows mercy for a certain time, and then he hardens the heart of the sinner. How does God
harden the hearts of sinners? St. Augustine answers: ” **_Obduratio Dei est non misereri."_** The
Lord does not directly harden the hearts of habitual sinners; but, in punishment of their
ingratitude for his benefits, he withdraws from them his graces, and thus their hearts are
hardened, and become like a stone. ”God does not harden the heart by imparting malice, but
by withholding mercy." God does not render sinners obdurate by infusing the malice of
obstinacy, but by not giving them the efficacious graces by which they would be converted.
By the withdrawal of the suns heat from the earth, water is hardened into ice.


9. St. Bernard teaches, that hardness or obstinacy of heart does not take place suddenly; but,
by degrees **_the soul becomes insensible to the divine threats, and more obstinate by divine
chastisements. "Paulatim in cordis dulitiam itur; cor durum non minis cedit, flagellis
duratur."_** In habitual sinners are verified the words of David, ” **_And thy rebuke, God of Jacob,
they have slumbered."_** (Ps. lxxv. 7.) Even earthquakes, thunders, and sudden deaths do not
terrify an habitual sinner. Instead of awakening him to a sense of his miserable state, they
rather bring on that deadly sleep in which he slumbers and is lost.


**_Third Point. A bad habit diminishes our strength._**





10. **_"He hath torn me with wound upon wound; he hath rushed in upon me like a giant."_** (Job
xvi. 15.) On this text St. Gregory reasons thus: A person assailed by an enemy, is rendered
unable to defend himself by the first wound which he receives; but, should he receive a
second and third, his strength will be so much exhausted, that death will be the consequence.
It is so with sin: after the first and second wound which it inflicts on the soul, she shall still
have some strength, but only through the divine grace. But, if she continue to indulge in vice,
sin, becoming habitual, rushes upon her like a giant and leaves her without any power to
resist it. St. Bernard compares the habitual sinner to a person who has fallen under a large
stone, which he is unable to remove. A person in such a case will rise only with difficulty.
**_“The man on whom the weight of a bad habit presses, rises with difficulty."_** St. Gregory says:
” **_Lapis superpositus, cum consuetudine mens in peccato demoratur ut esti velit exsurgere,
jam non possit quia moles desuper premit,"_** (Moral, lib. 26, c. xxiv.)


11. St. Thomas of Villanova teaches, that a soul which is deprived of the grace of God, cannot
long abstain from new sins. **_"Anima a gratia destituta diu evadere ulteriora peccata non
potest."_** (Conc. 4 in Dom. 4 quadrages.) In expounding the words of David, **_“O my God,
make them like a wheel, and as a stubble before the wind,"_** (Ps. lxxxii. 14.) St. Gregory says,
that the man who struggled for a time before he fell into the habit of sin, as soon as he
contracts the habit, yields and yields again to every temptation, with as much facility as a
straw is moved by the slightest blast of wind. Habitual sinners, according to St. Chrysostom,
become so weak in resisting the attacks of the devil, that, dragged to sin by their evil habit,
they are sometimes driven to sin against their inclination. ” **_Dura res est consuetudo, quæ
nonnunquam nolentes committere cogit illicita,"_** Yes; because, as St. Augustine says, a bad
habit in the course of time brings on a certain necessity of falling into sin. **_"Dum consuetudini
non resistitur, facta est necessitas."_**


12. St. Bernardino of Sienna says, that **_evil habits are changed into one‟s nature. ”Usus veritur
in natura."_** Hence, as it is necessary for men to breathe, so it appears that it becomes
necessary for habitual sinners to commit sins. They are thus made the slave of sin. I say, the
slaves. In society there are servants, who serve for wages, and there are slaves, who serve by
force, and without remuneration. Having sold themselves as slaves to the devil, habitual
sinners are reduced to such a degree of slavery, that they sometimes sin without pleasure,
and sometimes even without being in the occasion of sin. St. Bernardino compares them to
the wings of a windmill, which continue to turn the mill even when there is no corn to be
ground; that is, they continue to commit sin, at least by indulging bad thoughts, even when
there is no occasion of sin presented to them. The unhappy beings, as St. Chrysostom says,
having lost the divine aid, no longer do what they wish themselves, but what the devil
wishes. "Homo perdito Dei auxilio, non quod vult agit, sed quod diabolus."


13. Listen to what happened in a city in Italy. A certain young man, who had contracted a
vicious habit, though frequently called by God, and admonished by friends to amend his life,
continued to live in sin. One day he saw his sister suddenly struck dead. He was terrified for
a short time; but she was scarcely buried, when he forgot her death and returned to the
vomit. In two months after he was confined to bed by a slow fever. He then, sent for a
confessor, and made his confession. But after all this, on a certain day, he exclaimed: Alas!
how late have I known the rigour of divine justice! And turning to his physician, he said: Do
not torment me any longer by medicines; for my disease is incurable. I know for certain that



it will bring me to the grave. And to his friends, who stood around, he said: As for the life of
this body of mine there is no remedy, so for the life of my poor soul there is no hope. I expect
eternal death. God has abandoned me; this I see in the hardness of my heart. Friends and
religious came to encourage him to hope in the mercy of God; but his answer to all their
exhortations was, God has abandoned me. The writer who relates this fact says, that, being
alone with the young man, he said to him: Have courage; unite yourself with God; receive
the viaticum. Friend, replied the young man, speak to a stone. The confession which I have
made has been null for want of sorrow. I do not wish for a confessor, nor for the sacraments.
Do not bring me the viaticum; for, should you bring it, I will do that which must excite
horror. He then went away quite disconsolate; and returning to see the young man, learned
from his relatives that he expired during the night without the aid of a priest, and that near
his room frightful howlings were heard.



14. Behold the end of habitual sinners! Brethren, if you have the misfortune of having
contracted a habit of sin, make, as soon as possible, a general confession; for your past
confessions can scarcely have been valid. Go forth instantly from the slavery of the devil.
Attend to the advice of the Holy Ghost. **_"Give not thy ears to the cruel."_** (Prov. v. 9.) Why
will you serve the devil, your enemy, who is so cruel a master who makes you lead a life of
misery here, to bring you to a life of still greater misery in hell for all eternity? **_“Lazarus,
come forth. ”_** Go out of the pit of sin; give yourself immediately to God, who calls you, and is
ready to receive you if you turn to him. Tremble! this may be for you the last call, to which if
you do not correspond, you shall be lost.


**SERMON XXI. EASTER SUNDAY. - ON THE MISERABLE STATE OF RELAPSING
SINNERS.**
**_" Be not affrighted: you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen; he is not
here." MARK xvi. 6._**


I HOPE, my dear Christians, that, as Christ is risen, you have in this holy paschal time, gone
to confession, and have risen from your sins. But, attend to what St. Jerome teaches that
many begin well, but few persevere. **_"Incipere multorem est, perseverare paucorum."_** Now
the Holy Ghost declares, that he who perseveres in holiness to death, and not they who begin
a good life, shall be saved. **_"But he that shall persevere to the end, he shall be saved."_** (Matt.
xxiv. 13.) The crown of Paradise, says St. Bernard, is promised to those who commence, but it
is given only to those who persevere. ” **_Inchoantibus præmium promittitur, perseverantibus
datur."_** (Ser. vi. Deinodo bene viv.) Since, then, brethren, you have resolved to give
yourselves to God, listen to the admonition of the Holy Ghost: ” **_Son, when thou comest to the
service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thyself for temptation."_** (Eccl. ii. 1.)
Do not imagine that you shall have no more temptations, but prepare yourself for the
combat, and guard against a relapse into the sins you have confessed; for, if you lose the
grace of God again, you shall find it difficult to recover it. I intend this day to show you the
miserable state of relapsing sinners; that is, of those who, after confession, miserably fall back
into the sins which they confessed.


1. Since, then, dearly beloved Christians, you have made a sincere confession of your sins,
Jesus Christ says to you what he says to the paralytic: **_“Behold, thou art made whole. Sin no
more, lest some worse thing happen to thee."_** (John v. 14.) By the confessions which you have



made your souls are healed, but not as yet saved; for, if you return to sin, you shall be again
condemned to hell, and the injury caused by the relapse shall be far greater than that which
you sustained from your former sins. **_“Audis,"_** says St. Bernard, **_"recidere quam incidere, esse
deterius."_** If a man recover from a mortal disease, and afterwards fall back into it, he shall
have lost so much of his natural strength, that his recovery from the relapse will be
impossible. This is precisely what will happen to relaxing sinners; returning to the vomit that
is, taking back into the soul the sins vomited forth in confession they shall be so weak, that
they will become objects of amusement to the devil. St. Anselm says, that the devil acquires a
certain dominion over them, so that he makes them fall, and fall again as he wishes. Hence
the miserable beings become like birds with which a child amuses himself. He allows them,
from time to time, to fly to a certain height, and then draws them back again when he
pleases, by means of a cord made fast to them. Such is the manner in which the devil treats
relapsing sinners. **_"Sed quia ab hoste tenentur, volantes in eadem vitia dejiciuntur_** ."



2. St. Paul tells us, that we have to contend not with men like ourselves, made of flesh and
blood, but with the princes of hell. **_“Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against
principalities and powers."_** (Ephes. vii. 12.) By these words he wishes to admonish us that we
have not strength to resist the powers of hell, and that, to resist them, the divine aid is
absolutely necessary: without it, we shall be always defeated; but, with the assistance of
God’s grace, we shall, according to the same apostle, be able to do all things and shall
conquer all enemies. **_“I can do all things in him who strengtheneth me."_** (Phil. iv. 13.) But this
assistance God gives only to those who pray for it. **_“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
you shall find."_** (Matt. vii. 7.) They who neglect to ask, do not receive. Let us, then, be careful
not to trust in our resolutions: if we place our confidence in them, we shall be lost. When we
are tempted to relapse into sin, we must put our whole trust in the assistance of God, who
infallibly hears all who invoke his aid.


3 ” **_He that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall." (_** 1 Cor. x. 12.) They who
are in the state of grace should, according to St. Paul, be careful not to fall into sin,
particularly if they have been ever guilty of mortal sins; for a relapse into sin brings greater
evil on the soul. **_“And the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. ”_** (Luke xi. 26.)


4. We are told in the Holy Scriptures, that the enemy **_“will offer victims to his drag, and will
sacrifice to his net; because through them his meat is made dainty."_** (Habac. i. 16.) In
explaining this passage St. Jerome says, that the devil seeks to catch in his nets all men, in
order to sacrifice them to the divine justice by their damnation. Sinners, who are already in
the net, he endeavours to bind with new chains; but the friends of God are his **_“dainty
meats."_** To make them his slaves, and to rob them of all they have acquired, he prepares
stronger snares. **_“The more fervently,"_** says Denis the Carthusian, **_"a soul endeavours to serve
God, the more fiercely does the adversary rage against her."_** The closer the union of a
Christian with God, and the greater his efforts to serve God, the more the enemy is aimed
with rage, and the more strenuously he labours to enter into the soul from which he has been
expelled. **_“When,"_** says the Redeemer, ” **_the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, seeking rest,
and not finding, he saith: I will return into my house, whence I came out."_** (Luke xi. 24.)
Should he succeed in re-entering, he will not enter alone, but will bring with him associates
to fortify himself in the soul of which he has again got possession. Thus, the second



destruction of that miserable soul shall be greater than the first. **_“And the last state of that
man becomes worse than the first."_** (Luke xi. 26.)


5. To God, the relapse of ungrateful Christians is very displeasing. Because, after he had
called and pardoned them with so much love, he sees that, forgetful of his mercies to them,
they again turn their back upon him and renounce his grace. **_“If my enemy had reviled me, I
would verily have borne with it. But thou, a man of one mind, my guide and familiar, who
didst take sweet meats together with me. ”_** (Ps. liv. 13, etc.) Had my enemy, says the Lord,
insulted me, I would have felt less pain; but to see you rebel against me, after I had restored
my friendship to you, and after I had made you sit at my table, to eat my own flesh, grieves
me to the heart, and impels me to take vengeance on you. Miserable the man who, after
having received so many graces from God, becomes the enemy, from being the friend of God.
He shall find the sword of divine vengeance prepared to chastise him. **_“And he that passes
over from justice to sin, God hath prepared such an one for the sword."_** (Eccl. xxvi. 27.)



6. Some of you may say: If I relapse, I will soon rise again; for I will immediately prepare
myself for confession. To those who speak in this manner shall happen what befell Samson.
He allowed himself to be deluded by Dalila: while he was asleep she cut off his hair, and his
strength departed from him. Awaking from sleep, he said: **_"I will go out as I did before, and
shake myself, not knowing that the Lord was departed from him. ”_** (Judges xvi. 20.) He
expected to deliver himself as on former occasions, from the hands of the Philistines. But,
because his strength had departed from him, he was made their slave. They pulled out his
eyes, and binding him in chains, shut him up in prison. After relapsing into sin, a Christian
loses the strength necessary to resist temptations, because **_“the Lord departs from him."_** He
abandons him by withholding the efficacious aid necessary to overcome temptations; and the
miserable man remains blind and abandoned in his sin.


7. **_"No man putting his hand to the plough, and looking back is fit for the Kingdom of God."_**
(Luke ix. 62.) Behold a faithful picture of a relapsing sinner. Mark the words no man: no one,
says Jesus Christ, who begins to serve me, and looks back, is fit to enter heaven. According to
Origen, the addition of a new sin to one committed before, is like the addition of a new
wound to a wound just inflicted. **_“Cum peccatum peccato adjicitur, sicut vulnus vulneri."_**
(Hom. i. in Ps.) If a wound be inflicted on any member of the body, that member certainly
loses its original vigour. But, if it receives a second wound, it shall lose all strength and
motion, without hope of recovery. The great evil of a relapse into sin is, that it renders the
soul so weak that she has but little strength to resist temptation. For St. Thomas says, **_“After a
fault has been remitted, the dispositions produced by the preceding acts remain."_** (1 p., qu.
86, art. 5.) Every sin, though pardoned, always leaves a wound on the soul. When to this
wound a new one is added, the soul becomes so weak that, without a special and
extraordinary grace from God, it is impossible for her to conquer temptations.


8. Let us, then, brethren, tremble at the thought of relapsing into sin, and let us beware of
availing ourselves of the mercy of God to continue to offend him. ”He," says St. Augustine,
”who has promised pardon to penitents, has promised repentance to no one." God has
indeed promised pardon to all who repent of their sins, but he has not promised to any one
the grace to repent of the faults which he has committed. Sorrow for sin is a pure gift of God;
if he withholds it, how will you repent? And without repentance, how can you obtain



pardon? Ah! the Lord will not allow himself to be mocked. ”Be not deceived," says St. Paul,
”God is not mocked." (Gal. vi. 7.) St. Isidore tells us, that the man who repeats the sin which
he before detested, is not a penitent, but a scoffer of God’s majesty. **_“Irrisor, et non pœnitens
est, pui adhuc agit, quod pœnitet."_** (De Sum. Bono.) And Tertullian teaches, that where there
is no amendment, repentance is not sincere. ” **_Ubi emendatio nulla, pœnitentia nulla."_** (De
Pœnit.)



9. **_"Be penitent,"_** said St. Peter in a discourse to the Jews, ” **_and be converted, that your sins
may be blotted out."_** (Acts iii. 19.) Many repent, but are not converted. They feel a certain
sorrow for the irregularities of their lives, but do not sincerely return to God. They go to
confession, strike their breasts, and promise to amend; but they do not make a firm resolution
to change their lives. They who resolve firmly on a change of life, persevere, or at least
preserve themselves for a considerable time in the grace of God. But they who relapse into
sin soon after confession, show, as St. Peter says, that they repent, but are not converted; and
such persons shall in the end die an unhappy death. **_"Plerumque,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_mali sic
compunguntur ad justitiam, sicut plerumque boni tentantur ad culpam."_** (Pastor., p. 3,
admon. 31.) As the just have frequent temptations to sin, but yield not to them, because their
will abhors them, so sinners feel certain impulses to virtue; but these are not sufficient to
produce a true conversion. The Wise Man tells us that mercy shall be shown to him who
confesses his sins and abandons them, but not to those who merely confess their
transgressions. **_"He that shall confess “his sins, ” and forsake them, shall obtain mercy."_**
(Prov. xxviii. 13.) He, then, who does not give up, but returns to sin after confession, shall not
obtain mercy from God, but shall die a victim of divine justice. He may expect to die the
death of a certain young Englishman, who, as is related in the history of England, was in the
habit of relapsing into sins against purity. He always fell back into these sins after confession.
At the hour of death he confessed his sins, and died in a manner which gave reason to hope
for his salvation. But, while a holy priest was celebrating or preparing to celebrate Mass for
his departed soul, the miserable young man appeared to him, and said that he was damned.
He added that, at the point of death, being tempted to indulge a bad thought, he felt himself
as it were forced to consent, and, as he was accustomed to do in the former part of his life, he
yielded to the temptation, and thus was lost.


10. Is there then no means of salvation for relapsing sinners? I do not say this; but I adopt the
maxim of physicians. **_“In inagnis morbis a magnis initium medendi sumere oportet." In
malignant diseases, powerful remedies are necessary._** To return to the way of salvation, the
relapsing sinner must do great violence to himself. ”The kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent bear it away." (Matt. xi. 12.) In the beginning of a new life, the
relapsing sinner must do violence to himself in order to root out the bad habits which he has
contracted, and to acquire habits of virtue; for when he has acquired habits of virtue, the
observance of the divine commands shall become easy and even sweet. The Lord once said to
St. Bridget, that, to those who bear with fortitude the first punctures of the thorns which they
experience in the attacks of the senses, in avoiding occasions of sin, and in withdrawing from
dangerous conversations, these thorns are by degrees changed into roses.


11. But, to use the necessary violence, and to lead a life of regularity, you must adopt the
proper means; otherwise you shall do nothing. After rising in the morning, you must make
acts of thanksgiving, of the love of God, and of oblation of the actions of the day. You must



also renew your resolution never to offend God, and beg of Jesus Christ and his holy mother
to preserve you from sin during the day. Afterwards make your meditation and hear Mass.
During the day make a spiritual lecture and a visit to the most holy sacrament. In the
evening, say the Rosary and make an examination of conscience. Receive the holy
communion at least once a week, or more frequently if your directors advise you. Be careful
to choose a confessor, to whom you will regularly go to confession. It is also very useful to
make a spiritual retreat every year in some religious house. Honour the mother of God every
day by some particular devotion, and by fasting on every Saturday. She is the mother of
perseverance, and promises to obtain it for all who serve her. **_“They that work by me shall
not sin."_** (Eccl. xxiv. 30.) Above all, it is necessary to ask of God every morning the gift of
perseverance, and to beg of the Blessed Virgin to obtain it for you, and particularly in the
time of temptation, by invoking the name of Jesus and Mary as long as the temptation lasts.
Happy the man who will continue to act in this manner, and shall he found so doing when
Jesus Christ shall come to judge him. **_“Blessed is that servant, whom, when his Lord shall
come, he shall find so doing_** ." (Matt. xxiv. 46.)


**SERMON XXII. FIRST SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. - ON AVOIDING THE OCCASIONS
OF SIN.**
**_"When the doors were shut, where His disciples were gathered together for fear of the Jews,
Jesus came and stood in the midst." JOHN xx. 19._**


WE find in this day’s gospel that after his resurrection Jesus Christ entered, though the doors
were closed, into the house in which the apostles were assembled, and stood in the midst of
them. St. Thomas says, that the mystic meaning of this miracle is, that the Lord does not enter
into our souls unless we keep the door of the senses shut. **_"Mistice per hoc datur intelligi,
quod Christus nobit apparet quando fores, id est sensus sunt clausi."_** If, then, we wish Jesus
Christ to dwell within us, we must keep the doors of our senses closed against dangerous
occasions, otherwise the devil will make us his slaves. I will show Today the great danger of
perdition to which they who do not avoid the occasions of sin expose themselves.



1. We read in the Scriptures that Christ and Lazarus arose from the dead. Christ rose to die
no more **_"Christ rising from the dead, dieth no more”_** (Rom. vi. 9); but Lazarus arose and died
again. The Abbot Guerric remarks that Christ arose free and unbound; **_"but Lazarus came
forth bound feet and hands."_** (John xi. 44.) Miserable the man, adds this author, who rises
from sin bound by any dangerous occasion: he will die again by losing the divine grace. He,
then, who wishes to save his soul, must not only abandon sin, but also the occasions of sin:
that is, he must renounce such an intimacy, such a house; he must renounce those wicked
companions, and all similar occasions that incite him to sin.


2. In consequence of original sin, we all have an inclination to do what is forbidden. Hence St.
Paul complained that he experienced in himself a law opposed to reason: **_“But I see another
law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of
sin."_** (Rom. vii. 23.) Now, when a dangerous occasion is present, it violently excites our
corrupt desires, so that it is then very difficult to resist them: because God withholds
efficacious helps from those who voluntarily expose themselves to the occasion of sin. **_"He
that loveth danger shall perish in it."_** (Eccl. iii. 27.)” **_When,"_** says St. Thomas, in his comment
on this passage, **_"we expose ourselves to danger, God abandons us in it."_** St. Bernardine of



Sienna **_teaches that the counsel of avoiding the occasions of sin is the best of all counsel, and
as it were the foundation of religion. “Inter consilia Christi unum celeberrimum, et quasi
religiouis fundamentum est, fugere peccatorum occasiones."_**



3. St. Peter says that” **_the devil goeth about seeking whom he may devour."_** (1 Pet. v. 8.) He is
constantly going about our souls, endeavouring to enter and take possession of them. Hence,
he seeks to place before us the occasions of sin, by which he enters the soul. ” **_Explorat,"_** says
St. Cyprian, ” **_an sit pars cujus aditu penetret."_** When the soul yields to the suggestions of the
devil, and exposes herself to the occasions of sin, he easily enters and devours her. The ruin
of our first parents arose from their not flying from the occasions of sin. God had prohibited
them not only to eat, but even to touch the forbidden apple. In answer to the serpent
tempting her, Eve said: **_"God hath commanded us that we should not eat, and that we
should not touch it."_** (Gen. iii. 3.) But” **_she saw, took, and eat”_** the forbidden fruit: she first
looked at it, she then took it into her hands, and afterwards eat it. This is what ordinarily
happens to all who expose themselves to the occasions of sin. Hence, being once compelled
by exorcisms to tell the sermon which displeased him most, the devil confessed that it was
the sermon on avoiding the occasions of sin. As long as we expose ourselves to the occasions
of sin, the devil laughs at all our good purposes and promises made to God. The greatest care
of the enemy is to induce us not to avoid evil occasions; for these occasions, like a veil placed
before the eyes, prevent us from seeing either the lights received from God, or the eternal
truths, or the resolutions we have made: in a word, they make us forget all, and as it were
force us into sin.


4. ” **_Know it to be a communication with death; for thou art going in the midst of snares."_**
(Eccl. ix. 20.) Everyone born in this world enters into the midst of snares. Hence, the Wise
Man advises those who wish to be secure to guard themselves against the snares of the
world, and to withdraw from them. **_"He that is aware of the snares shall be secure."_** (Prov.
xi. 15.) But if, instead of withdrawing from them, a Christian approaches to them, how can he
avoid being caught by them? Hence, after having with so much loss learned the danger of
exposing himself to the danger of sin, David said that, to continue faithful to God, he kept at
a distance from every occasion which could lead him to relapse. **_“I have restrained my feet
from every evil way, that I may keep thy words."_** (Ps. cxviii. 101.) He does not say from every
sin, but from every evil way which conducts to sin. The devil is careful to find pretexts to
make us believe that certain occasions to which we expose ourselves are not voluntary, but
necessary. When the occasion in which we are placed is really necessary, the Lord always
helps us to avoid sin; but we sometimes imagine certain necessities which are not sufficient to
excuse us. **_“A treasure is never safe”_** says St. Cyprian, **_"as long as a robber is harboured
within; nor is a lamb secure while it dwells in the same den with a wolf."_** (Lib. de Sing. Cler.)
The saint speaks against those who do not wish to remove the occasions of sin, and still say:
"I am not afraid that I shall fall." As no one can be secure of his treasure if he keeps a thief in
his house, and as a lamb cannot be sure of its life if it remain in the den of a wolf, so likewise
no one can be secure of the treasure of divine grace if he is resolved to continue in the
occasion of sin. St. James teaches that every man has within himself a powerful enemy, that
is, his own evil inclinations, which tempt him to sin. ” **_Every man is tempted by his own
concupiscence, drawn away, and allured."_** (St. James i. 14.)





If, then, we do not fly from the external occasions, how can we resist temptation and avoid
sin? Let us, therefore, place before our eyes the general remedy which Jesus has prescribed
for conquering temptations and saving our souls. ” **_If thy right eye scandalize thee, pluck it
out and cast it from thee."_** (Matt. v. 29.) If you find that your right eye is to you a cause of
damnation, you must pull it out and cast it far from you; that is, when there is danger of
losing your soul, you must fly from all evil occasions. St. Francis of Assisium used to say, as I
have stated in another sermon, **_that the devil does not seek, in the beginning, to bind
timorous souls with the chain of mortal sin; because they would be alarmed at the thought
of committing mortal sin, and would fly from it with horror: he endeavours to bind them by
a single hair, which does not excite much fear; because by this means he will succeed more
easily in strengthening their bonds, till he makes them his slaves._** Hence he who wishes to be
free from the danger of being the slave of hell must break all the hairs by which the enemy
attempts to bind him; that is, he must avoid all occasions of sin, such as certain salutations,
billets, little presents, and words of affection. With regard to those who have had a habit of
impurity, it will not be sufficient to avoid proximate occasions; if they do not fly from remote
occasions, they will very easily relapse into their former sins.



5. Impurity, says St. Augustine, is a vice which makes war on all, and which few conquer.
**_“The fight is common, but the victory rare."_** How many miserable souls have entered the
contest with this vice, and have been defeated! But to induce you to expose yourselves to
occasions of this sin, the devil will tell you not to be afraid of being overcome by the
temptation. **_“I do not wish,"_** says St. Jerome, **_"to fight with the hope of victory, lest I should
sometimes lose the victory." I_** will not expose myself to the combat with the hope of
conquering; because, by voluntarily engaging in the fight, I shall lose my soul and my God.
To escape defeat in this struggle, a great grace of God is necessary; and to render ourselves
worthy of this grace, we must, on our part, avoid the occasions of sin. To practise the virtue
of chastity, it is necessary to recommend ourselves continually to God: we have not strength
to preserve it; that strength must be the gift of God. **_“And as I knew,"_** says the Wise Man,
” **_that I could not otherwise be continent, except God gave it, ... I went to the Lord, and
besought him."_** (Wis. viii. 21.) But if we expose ourselves to the occasions of sin, we ourselves
shall provide our rebellious flesh with arms to make war against the soul. **_“Neither,"_** says the
Apostle, **_“yield ye your members as instruments of sin unto iniquity."_** (Rom. vi. 13.) In
explaining this passage, St. Cyril of Alexandria says: **_“You stimulate the flesh; you arm it,
and make it powerful against the spirit."_** St. Philip Neri used to say, that in the war against
the vice of impurity, the victory is gained by cowards that is, by those who fly from the
occasions of this sin. But the man who exposes himself to it, arms his flesh, and renders it so
powerful, that it will be morally impossible for him to resist its attacks.


6. **_"Cry,"_** says the Lord to Isaias, **_“all flesh is grass."_** (Isa. xl. 6.) Now, says St. John
Chrysostom, if all flesh is grass, it is as foolish for a man who exposes himself to the occasion
of sin to hope to preserve the virtue of purity, as to expect that hay, into which a torch has
been thrown, will not take fire. ” **_Put a torch into hay, and then dare to deny that the hay will
burn."_** No, says St. Cyprian; it is impossible to stand in the midst of flames, and not to burn.
” **_Impossibile est flammis circumdari et non ardere."_** (De Sing. Cler.)” **_Can a man,"_** says the
Holy Ghost, **_"hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn? or can he walk upon hot
coals, and his feet not be burnt ?"_** (Prov. vi. 27, 28.) Not to be burnt in such circumstances
would be a miracle. St. Bernard teaches, that to preserve chastity, and, at the same time, to



expose oneself to the proximate occasion of sin, ”is a greater miracle than to raise a dead man
to life."



7. In explaining the fifth Psalm, St. Augustine says, that **_“he who is unwilling to fly from
danger, wishes to perish in it_** ." Hence, in another place, he exhorts those who wish to
conquer, and not to perish, to avoid dangerous occasions. ” **_In the occasion of falling into sin,
take flight, if you desire to gain the victory."_** (Serm. ecl. de temp.) Some foolishly trust in
their own strength, and do not see that their strength is like that of tow placed in the fire.
” **_And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow." (_** Isa. i. 31 .) Others, trusting in the change
which has taken place in their life, in their confessions, and in the promises they have made
to God, say: Through the grace of the Lord, I have now no bad motive in seeking the
company of such a person; her presence is not even an occasion of temptations: Listen, all
you who speak in this manner. In Mauritania there are bears that go in quest of the apes, to
feed upon them: as soon as a bear appears, the apes run up the trees, and thus save
themselves. But what does the bear do? He stretches himself on the ground as if dead, and
waits till the apes descend from the trees. The moment he sees that they have descended, he
springs up, seizes on them, and devours them. It is thus the devil acts: he makes the
temptation appear to be dead; but when a soul descends, and exposes herself to the occasion
of sin, he stirs up temptation, and devours her. Oh! how many miserable souls, devoted to
spiritual things, to mental prayer, to frequent communion, and to a life of holiness, have, by
exposing themselves to the occasion of sin, become the slaves of the devil! We find in
ecclesiastical history that a holy woman, who employed herself in the pious office of burying
the martyrs, once found among them one who was not as yet dead. She brought him into her
own house, and procured a physician and medicine for him, till he recovered. But, what
happened? These two saints (as they might be called one of them on the point of being a
martyr, the other devoting her time to works of mercy with so much risk of being persecuted
by the tyrants) first fell into sin and lost the grace of God, and, becoming weaker by sin,
afterwards denied the faith. St. Macarius relates a similar fact regarding an old man who
suffered to be half-burned in defence of the faith; but, being brought back into prison, he,
unfortunately for himself, formed an intimacy with a devout woman who served the
martyrs, and fell into sin.


8. The Holy Ghost tells us, that we must fly from sin as from a serpent. **_“Flee from sin as
from, the face of a serpent."_** (Eccl. xxi. 2.) Hence, as we not only avoid the bite of a serpent,
but are careful neither to touch nor approach it, so we must fly not only from sin, but also
from the occasion of sin that is, from the house, the conversation, the person that would lead
us to sin. St. Isidore says, that he who wishes to remain near a serpent, will not remain long
unhurt. **_"Juxta serpentem positus non erit din illæsus."_** (Lib. 2, Solit.) Hence, if any person is
likely to prove an occasion of your ruin, the admonition of the Wise Man is, **_“Remove thy
way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house."_** (Prov. v. 8.) He not only tells
you not to enter the house which has been to you a road to hell. **_“Her house is the way to
hell."_** Prov. vii. 27); but he also cautions you not to approach it, and even to keep at a distance
from it. ”Remove thy way far from her." But, you will say, if I abandon that house, my
temporal affairs shall suffer. It is better that you should suffer a temporal loss, than that you
should lose your soul and your God. You must be persuaded that, in whatever regards
chastity, there cannot be too great caution.





If we wish to save our souls from sin and hell, we must always fear and tremble. ” **_With fear
and trembling work out your salvation. ”_** (Phil. ii. 12.) He who is not fearful, but exposes
himself to occasions of sin, shall scarcely be saved. Hence, in our prayers we ought to say
every day, and several times in the day, that petition of the OUR FATHER” **_and lead us not
into temptation."_** Lord, do not permit me to be attacked by those temptations which would
deprive me of your grace. We cannot merit the grace of perseverance; but, according to St.
Augustine, God grants it to every one that asks it, because he has promised to hear all who
pray to him. Hence, the holy doctor says, that the Lord, **_“by his promises has made himself a
debtor."_**


**SERMON XXIII. SECOND SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. - ON SCANDAL.**
**_“The wolf catcheth and scattereth the sheep. 1 JOHN x. 12._**


THE wolves that catch and scatter the sheep of Jesus Christ are the authors of scandal, who,
not content with their own destruction, labour to destroy others. But the Lord says: ” **_Woe to
that man by whom the scandal cometh."_** (Matt, xviii. 7.) Woe to him who gives scandal, and
causes others to lose the grace of God. Origen says, that **_“a person who impels another to sin,
sins more grievously than the other."_** If, brethren, there be any among you who has given
scandal, I will endeavour this day to convince him of the evil he has done, that he may bewail
it and guard against it for the future. I will show, in the first point, the great displeasure
which the sin of scandal gives to God; and, in the second, the great punishment which God
threatens to inflict on the authors of scandal.


**_First Point. On the great displeasure which the sin of scandal gives to God._**



1. It is, in the first place, necessary to explain what is meant by scandal. Behold how St.
Thomas defines it: **_“Scandal is a word or act which gives occasion to the ruin of one‟s
neighbour."_** (2 ii., q. 45, art. 1.) Scandal, then, is a word or act by which you are to your
neighbour the cause or occasion of losing his soul. It may be direct or indirect. It is direct,
when you directly tempt or induce another to commit sin. It is indirect, when, although you
foresee that sinful words or actions will be the cause of sin to another, you do not abstain
from them. But, scandal, whether it be direct or indirect, if it be in a matter of great moment,
is always a mortal sin.


2. Let us now see the great displeasure which the destruction of a neighbour’s soul gives to
God. To understand it, we must consider how dear every soul is to God. Ho has created the
souls of all men to his own image. **_“Let us make man to our image and likeness."_** (Gen. i. 26.)
Other creatures God has made by a fiat by an act of his will; but the soul of man he has
created by his own breath. **_"And the Lord breathed into his face the breath of life."_** (Gen. ii.
7.) The soul of your neighbour God has loved for eternity. **_"I have loved thee with an
everlasting love."_** (Jer. xxxi. 3.) He has, moreover, created every soul to be a queen in
Paradise, and to be a partner in his glory. **_“That by these you may be made partakers of the
divine nature."_** (2 Peter i. 4.) In heaven he will make the souls of the saints partakers of his
own joy. ”Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." (Matt. xxv. 21. To them he shall give himself as
their reward. **_“I am thy reward exceeding great."_** (Gen. xv. 1.)





3. But nothing can show the value which God sets on the souls of men more clearly than
what the Incarnate Word has done for their redemption from sin and hell. ” **_If,"_** says St.
Eucharius, ” **_you do not believe your Creator, ask your Redeemer, how precious you are."_**
Speaking of the care which we ought to have of our brethren, St. Ambrose says: ” **_The great
value of the salvation of a brother is known from the death of Christ."_** We judge of the value
of everything by the price paid for it by an intelligent purchaser. Now, Jesus Christ has,
according to the Apostle, purchased the souls of men with his own blood. ” **_You are bought
with a great price."_** (1 Cor. vi. 20.) We can, then, say, that **_the soul is of as much value as the
blood of a God._** Such, indeed, is the language of St. Hilary” **_Tam copioso munere redemptio
agitur, ut homo Deum valere videatur."_** Hence, the Saviour tells us, that whatsoever good or
evil we do to the least of his brethren, we do to himself. ” **_So long as you did it to one of these
my least brethren, you did it to me."_** (Matt. xxv. 40.)


4. From all this we may infer how great is the displeasure given to God by scandalizing a
brother, and destroying his soul. It is enough to say, that they who give scandal rob God of a
child, and murder a soul, for whose salvation he has spent his blood and his life. Hence, St.
Leo calls the authors of scandals murderers. **_"Quisquis scandalizat, mortem infert animæ
proximi."_** They are the most impious of murderers; because they kill not the body, but the
soul of a brother, and rob Jesus Christ of all his tears, of his sorrows, and of all that he has
done and suffered to gain that soul. Hence the Apostle says: **_"Now, when you sin thus
against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ_** ." (1 Cor. viii.
12.) They who scandalize a brother, sin against Christ; because, as St. Ambrose says, they
deprive him of a soul for which he has spent so many years, and submitted to so many toils
and labours. It is related, that B. Albertus Magnus spent thirty years in making a head, which
resembled the human head, and uttered words: and that St. Thomas, fearing that it was done
by the agency of the devil, took the head and broke it. B. Albertus complained of the act of St.
Thomas, saying: **_"You have broken on me the work of thirty years."_** I do not assert that this is
true; but it is certain that, when Jesus Christ sees a soul destroyed by scandal, he can reprove
the author of it, and say to him: Wicked wretch, what have you done? **_You have deprived me
of this soul, for which I have laboured thirty-three years._**


5. We read in the Scriptures, that the sons of Jacob, after having sold their brother Joseph to
certain merchants, told his father that wild beasts had devoured him. ” **_Fera pessima
devoravit eum_** ." (Gen. xxxvii. 20.) To convince their father of the truth of what they said, they
dipped the coat of Joseph in the blood of a goat, and presented it to him, saying: **_"See whether
this be thy son‟s coat or not”_** (v. 32). In reply, the afflicted father said with tears: ” **_It is my
son‟s coat: an evil wild beast hath eaten him”_** (v. 33). Thus, we may imagine that, when a
soul is brought into sin by scandal, the devils present to God the garment of that soul dipped
in the blood of the Immaculate Lamb, Jesus Christ that is, the grace lost by that scandalized
soul, which Jesus Christ had purchased with his blood and that they say to the Lord: **_“See
whether this be thy son‟s coat or not."_** If God were capable of shedding tears, he would weep
more bitterly than Jacob did, at the sight of that lost soul his murdered child and would say:
” **_It is my son‟s coat: an evil wild beast hath eaten him."_** The Lord will go in search of this
wild beast, saying: **_"Where is the beast? where is the beast that has devoured my child ?"_**
When he finds the wild beast, what shall he do with him?





6. **_"I will,"_** says the Lord by his prophet Osee, **_"meet them as a bear that is robbed of her
whelps."_** (Osee xiii. 8.) When the bear comes to her den, and finds not her whelps, she goes
about the wood in search of the person who took them away. When she discovers the person,
oh! with what fury does she rush upon him! It is thus the Lord shall rush upon the authors of
scandal, who have robbed him of his children. Those who have given scandal, will say: My
neighbour is already damned; how can I repair the evil that has been done? The Lord shall
answer: Since you have been the cause of his perdition, you must pay me for the loss of his
soul. **_"I will require his blood at thy hands." (Ezec. iii. 20.) It is written in Deuteronomy,
"Thou shalt not pity him, but shalt require life for life"_** (xix. 21). You have destroyed a soul;
you must suffer the loss of your own. Let us pass to the second point.


**_Second Point. The great punishment which God threatens to those who give scandal._**


7. ” **_Woe to that man by whom the scandal cometh."_** (Matt, xviii. 7.) If the displeasure given
to God by scandal be great, the chastisement which awaits the authors of it must be frightful.
Behold how Jesus Christ speaks of this chastisement: ” **_But he that shall scandalize one of
these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a mill-stone should be hanged
about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea."_** (Matt, xviii. 6.) If a
malefactor dies on the scaffold, he excites the compassion of the spectators, who, at least,
pray for him, if they cannot deliver him from death. But, were he cast into the depths of the
sea, there should be no one present to pity his fate. A certain author says, that Jesus Christ
threatens the person who scandalizes a brother with this sort of punishment, to signify that
he is so hateful to the angels and saints, that they do not wish to recommend to God the man
who has brought a soul to perdition**_. "He is declared unworthy not only to be assisted, but
even to be seen."_** (Mansi. cap. iii. num. 4.)


8. St. John Chrysostom says, that scandal is so abominable in the eyes of God, that though he
overlooks very grievous sins, he cannot allow the sin of scandal to pass without condign
punishment. **_"Tam Deo horribile est scandalum, ut peccata graviora dissimulet non autem
peccata ubi frater scandalizatur."_** God himself says the same by the prophet Ezechiel: **_"Every
man of the house of Israel, if he ... set up the stumbling block of his iniquity ... I will make
him an example and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people."_** (Ezec. xiv.
7, 8.) And, in reality, scandal is one of the sins which we find in the sacred Scriptures
punished by God with the greatest rigour. Of Heli, because he did not correct his sons, who
gave scandal by stealing the flesh offered in sacrifice (for parents give scandal, not only by
giving bad example, but also by not correcting their children as they ought), the Lord said:
**_"Behold, I do a thing in Israel: and whosoever shall hear it, both his ears shall tingle."_** (1
Kings, iii. 11.) And speaking of the scandal given by the sons of Heli, the inspired writer says:
**_"Wherefore the sin of the young men was exceeding great before the Lord."_** (Ibid. ii. 17.) What
was this sin exceeding great? It was, says St. Gregory, in explaining this passage, drawing
others to sin. **_"Quia ad pecandum alios pertrahebant."_** Why was Jeroboam chastised?
Because he scandalized the people: he” **_hath sinned, and made Israel sin."_** (3 Kings, xiv. 16.)
In the family of Achab, all the members of which were the enemies of God, Jezabel was the
most severely chastised. She was thrown down from a window, and devoured by dogs, so
that nothing remained but her” **_skull, and the feet, and the extremities of her hands."_** And
why was she so severely punished? Because **_"she set Achab on to every evil."_**





9. For the sin of scandal hell was created. **_"In the beginning God created heaven and earth."_**
(Gen. i. 1 .) But, when did he create hell? It was then Lucifer began to seduce the angels into
rebellion against God. Lest he should continue to pervert those who remained faithful to
God, he was banished from heaven immediately after his sin. Hence Jesus Christ said to the
Pharisees, who, by their bad example, scandalized the people, that they were children of the
devil, who was from the beginning, a murderer of souls. ” **_You are of your father, the devil: he
was a murderer from the beginning."_** (John viii. 44.) And when St. Peter gave scandal to Jesus
Christ, by suggesting to him not to allow his life to be taken away by the Jews, and thus
endeavouring to prevent the accomplishment of redemption, the Redeemer called him a
devil. ” **_Go behind me, Satan; thou art a scandal to me."_** (Matt. xvi. 23.) And, in reality, what
other office do the authors of scandal perform, than that of a minister of the devil? If he were
not assisted by such impious ministers, he certainly would not succeed in gaining so many
souls. A scandalous companion does more injury than a hundred devils.


10. On the words of Ezechias, **_"Behold, in peace is my bitterness most bitter"_** (Isa. xxxviii. 17),
St. Bernard, in the name of the Church, says: **_“Peace from pagans, peace from heretics, but no
peace from children."_** At present the Church is not persecuted by idolaters, or by heretics, but
she is persecuted by scandalous Christians, who are her own children. In catching birds, we
employ decoys, that is, certain birds that are blinded, and tied in such manner that they
cannot fly away. It is thus the devil acts. **_“When,"_** says St. Ephrem, **_"a soul has been taken,
she becomes a snare to deceive others."_** After having made a young man fall into sin, the
enemy first blinds him as his own slave, and then makes him his decoy to deceive others; and
to draw them into the net of sin, he not only impels, but even forces him to deceive others.
**_“The enemy,"_** says St. Leo, ” **_has many whom he compels to deceive others."_** (Serm. de Nativ.)


11. Miserable wretches! the authors of scandal must suffer in hell the punishment of all the
sins they have made others commit. Cesarius relates (1. 2, c. vi.) that, after the death of a
certain person who had given scandal, a holy man witnessed his judgment and
condemnation, and saw that, at his arrival at the gate of hell, all the souls whom he had
scandalized came to meet him, and said to him: Come, accursed wretch, and atone for all the
sins which you have made us commit. They then rushed in upon him, and like so many wild
beasts, began to tear him in pieces. St. Bernard says, that, in speaking of other sinners, the
Scriptures hold out hopes of amendment and pardon; but they speak of those who give
scandal as persons separated from God, of whose salvation there is very little hope. ”Lo
quitur tanquam a Deo separati, unde hisce nulla spes vitæ esse poterit."


12. Behold, then, the miserable state of those who give scandal by their bad example, who
utter immodest words before their companions, in the presence of young females, and even
of innocent children, who, in consequence of hearing those words, commit a thousand sins.
Considering how the angel-guardians of those little ones weep at seeing them in the state of
sin, and how they call for vengeance from God against the sacrilegious tongues that have
scandalized them. A great chastisement awaits all who ridicule those who practise virtue. For
many, through fear of the contempt and ridicule of others, abandon virtue, and give
themselves up to a wicked life. What shall be the punishment of those who bring messages to
induce others to sin? or of those who boast of their own wicked actions? God! instead of
weeping and repenting for having offended the Lord, they rejoice and glory in their
iniquities! Some advise others to commit sin; others induce them to it; and some, worse than



the devils, teach others how to sin. What shall we say of fathers and mothers, who, though it
is in their power to prevent the sins of their children, allow them to associate with bad
companions, or to frequent certain dangerous houses, and permit their daughters to hold
conversations with young men? Oh! with what scourges shall we see such persons chastised
on the day of judgment!



13. Perhaps some father of a family among you will say: Then, I am lost because I have given
scandal? Is there no hope of salvation for me? No: I will not say that you are past hope the
mercy of God is great. He has promised pardon to all who repent. But, if you wish to save
your soul, you must repair the scandal you have given. **_"Let him,"_** says Eusebius
Emmissenus, **_“who has destroyed himself by the destruction of many, redeem himself by the
edification of many."_** (Hom. x. ad Mon.) You have lost your soul, and have destroyed the
souls of many by your scandals. You are now bound to repair the evil. As you have hitherto
drawn others to sin, so you are bound to draw them to virtue by words of edification, by
good example, by avoiding sinful occasions, by frequenting the sacraments, by going often to
the church to pray, and by attending sermons. And from this day forward avoid, as you
would death, every act and word which could scandalize others. **_"Let their own ruin,"_** says
St. Cyprian, ” **_suffice for those who have fallen."_** (Lib. 1, epis. iii.) And St. Thomas of
Villanova says: **_"Let your own sins be sufficient for you."_** What evil has Jesus Christ done to
you that it is not enough for you to have offended him yourselves, but you wish to make
others offend him? This is an excess of cruelty.


14. Be careful, then, never again to give the smallest scandal. And if you wish to save your
soul, avoid as much as possible those who give scandal. These incarnate devils shall be
damned; but, if you do not avoid them, you will bring yourself to perdition. **_“Woe to the
world because of scandals,"_** says the Lord (Matt. xviii. 7), that is, many are lost because they
do not fly from occasions of scandal. But you may say: Such a person is my friend; I am
under obligations to him; I expect many favours from him. But Jesus Christ says: ” **_If thy right
eye scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. It is better for thee, having one eye, to
enter into life, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire."_** (Matt, xviii. 9.) Although a
certain person was your right eye, you must withdraw for ever from her; it is better for you
to lose an eye and save your soul, than to preserve it and be cast into hell.


**SERMON XXIV. THIRD SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. - ON THE VALUE OF TIME**
**_“A little while, and now you shall not see me." JOHN xvi. 16._**


THERE is nothing shorter than time, but there is nothing more valuable. There is nothing
shorter than time; because the past is no more, the future is uncertain, and the present is but a
moment. This is what Jesus Christ meant when he said: **_"A little while, and now you shall
not see me. ”_** We may say the same of our life, which, according to St. James is but a vapour,
which is soon scattered for ever. ” **_For what is your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a
little while."_** (James iv. 14.) But the time of this life is as precious as it is short; for, in every
moment, if we spend it well, we can acquire treasures of merits for heaven; but, if we employ
time badly, we may in each moment commit sin, and merit hell. I mean this day to show you
how precious is every moment of the time which God gives us, not to lose it, and much less
to commit sin, but to perform good works and to save our souls.





1. **_"Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time I have heard thee, and in the day of salvation I
have helped thee."_** (Isa. xlix. 8.) St. Paul explains this passage, and says, that the **_acceptable_**
time is the time in which God has determined to confer his favours upon us. He then adds:
” **_Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation."_** (2 Cor. vi. 2.) The
Apostle exhorts us not to spend unprofitably the present time, which he calls the day of
salvation; because, perhaps, after this day of salvation, there shall be no salvation for us. **_“The
time,"_** says the same Apostle, **_"is short; it remaineth that .they that weep be as though they
wept not; that they that rejoice, as if they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they
possessed not; and they that use this world, as if they used it not."_** (1 Cor. vii. 29, 30, 31.)


Since, then, the time which we have to remain on this earth is short, the Apostle tells those
who weep, that they ought not to weep, because their sorrows shall soon pass away; and
those who rejoice, not to fix their affections on their enjoyments, because they shall soon have
an end. Hence he concludes, that we should use this world, not to enjoy its transitory goods,
but to merit eternal life.


2. ” **_Son,"_** says the Holy Ghost, ” **_observe the time."_** (Eccl. iv. 2 3.) Son, learn to preserve time,
which is the most precious and the greatest gift that God can bestow upon you. St.
Bernardino of Sienna teaches that time is of as much value as God; because in every moment
of time well spent the possession of God is merited. He adds that in every instant of this life a
man may obtain the pardon of his sins, the grace of God, and the glory of Paradise. **_"Modico
tempore potest homo lucrari gratiam et gloriam."_** Hence St. Bonaventure says that **_“no loss
is of greater moment than the loss of time."_** (Ser. xxxvii. in Sept.)


3. But, in another place, St. Bernardino says that, **_though there is nothing more precious than
time, there is nothing less valuable in the estimation of men. ”Nil pretiosius tempore, nil
vilius reputatur."_** (Ser. ii. ad Schol.) You will see some persons spending four or five hours in
play. If you ask them why they lose so much time, they answer: To amuse ourselves. Others
remain half the day standing in the street, or looking out from a window. If you ask them
what they are doing, they shall say in reply, that they are passing the time. And why says the
same saint, do you lose this time? Why should you lose even a single hour, which the mercy
of God gives you to weep for your sins, and to acquire the divine grace? **_"Donec hora
pertranseat, quam tibi ad agendam pœnitentiam, ad acquirendam gratiam, miseratio
conditoris indulserit."_**


4. O time, despised by men during life, how much shall you be desired at the hour of death,
and particularly in the other world! Time is a blessing which we enjoy only in this life; it is
not enjoyed in the next; it is not found in heaven nor in hell. In hell, the damned exclaim with
tears: **_"Oh! that an hour were given to us."_** They would pay any price for an hour or for a
minute, in which they might repair their eternal ruin. But this hour or minute they never
shall have. In heaven there is no weeping; but, were the saints capable of sorrow, all their
wailing should arise from the thought of having lost in this life the time in which they could
have acquired greater glory, and from the conviction that this time shall never more be given
to them. A deceased Benedictine nun appeared in glory to a certain person, and said that she
was in heaven, and in the enjoyment of perfect happiness; but that, if she could desire
anything, it would be to return to life, and to suffer affliction, in order to merit an increase of
glory. And she added that, to acquire the glory which corresponded to a single Ave Maria,



she would be content to suffer till the day of judgment the long and painful sickness which
brought on her death. Hence, St. Francis Borgia was careful to employ every moment time for
God. When others spoke of useless things; he conversed with God by holy affections; and so
recollected was he that, when asked his opinion on the subject of conversation, he knew not
what answer to make. Being corrected for this, he said: I am content to be considered stupid,
rather than lose my time in vanities.



5. Some of you will say: What evil am I doing? Is it not, I ask, an evil to spend your time in
plays, in conversations, and useless occupations, which are unprofitable to the soul? Does
God give you this time to lose it? **_“Let not,"_** says the Holy Ghost, ” **_the part of a good gift
overpass thee."_** (Eccl. xiv. 14.) The work men of whom St. Matthew speaks did no evil; they
only lost time by remaining idle in the streets. But they were rebuked by the father of the
family, saying **_“Why stand you here all the day idle ?"_** (Matt. xx. 6.) On the day of judgment
Jesus Christ shall demand an account, not only of every month and day that has been lost,
but even of every idle word. ”Every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an
account for it on the day of judgment." (Matt. xii. 36.) He shall likewise demand an account of
every moment of the time which you shall lose. According to St. Bernard, all time which is
not spent for God is lost time. **_"Omne tempus quo de Deo non cogitasti, cogita te perdisse."_**
(Coll. 1, cap. viii.) Hence the Holy Ghost says: “ **_Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it
earnestly: for neither work nor reason... .shall be in hell, whither thou art hastening."_** (Eccl.
ix. 10.) What you can do Today defer not till to-morrow; for on tomorrow you may be dead,
and may be gone into another world, where you shall have no more time to do good, and
where you shall only enjoy the reward of your virtues, or suffer the punishment due to your
sins. **_“Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts."_** (Ps. xciv. 8.) God calls you
to confess your sins, to restore ill-gotten goods, to be reconciled with your enemies. Obey his
call to-day; for it may happen that on tomorrow time may be no more for you, or that God
will call you no more. All our salvation depends on corresponding with the divine calls, and
at the time that God calls us.


6. But some of you will perhaps say: **_I am young; after some time I will give myself to God._**
But, remember that the gospel tells us, that Jesus Christ cursed the fig tree which he found
without fruit, although the season for figs had not yet arrived. **_“It was not the time for figs."_**
(Mark xi. 13.) By this the Saviour wished to signify, that man at all times, even in youth,
should produce fruits of good works; and that otherwise, like the fig tree, he shall be cursed,
and shall produce no fruit for the future. **_“May no man here after eat any more fruit of thee
for ever."_** (Ibid., v. 1 4 .) **_”Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to
day; for his wrath shall come on a sudden."_** (Eccl. v. 8, 9.) If you find your soul in the state of
sin, delay not your repentance nor your confession; do not put them off even till to-morrow;
for, if you do not obey the voice of God calling you Today to confess your sins, death may
this day overtake you in sin, and tomorrow there may be no hope of salvation for you. The
devil regards the whole of our life as very short, and therefore he loses not a moment of time,
but tempts us day and night. ” **_The devil is come down unto you having great wrath, knowing
that he hath but a short time."_** (Apoc. xii. 12.) The enemy, then, never loses time in seeking to
bring us to hell: and shall we squander the time which God has given us to save our souls?


7. You say: **_"I will hereafter give myself to God."_** But **_“why”_** answers St. Bernard, **_"do you, a
miserable, sinner, presume on the future, as if the Father placed time in your power ?"_** (Serm.



xxxviii., de Part., etc.) Why do you presume that you will hereafter give yourself to God, as if
he had given to you the time and opportunity of returning to him whenever you wish? Job
said with trembling, that he knew not whether another moment of his life remained: **_"For I
know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me
away."_** (xxxii. 22.) And you say: I will not go to confession to-day; I will think of it tomorrow.
**_“Diem tenes,"_** says St. Augustine, **_“qui horam non tenes."_** How can you promise yourself
another day, when you know not whether you shall live another hour?” **_If,"_** says St. Teresa,
” **_you are not prepared to die today, tremble, lest you die an unhappy death."_**



8. St. Bernardino weeps over the blindness of those negligent Christians who squander the
days of salvation, and never consider that a day once lost shall never return. **_“Transcunt dies,
salutis et nemo recogitat sibi perire diem ut nunquam rediturum."_** (Serm. ad Scholar.) At the
hour of death they shall wish for another year, or for another day; but they shall not have it:
they shall then be told that **_"time shall be no more."_** What price would they not then give for
another week, for a day, or even for an hour, to prepare the account which they must then
render to God? St. Lawrence Justinian says, that for a single hour they would give all their
property, all their honours, and all their delights. **_“Erogaret opes, honores delicias, pro una
horula."_** (Vit. Solit., cap. x.) But this hour shall not be granted to them. The priest who attends
them shall say: Depart, depart immediately from this earth; for your time is no more. ” **_Go
forth, Christian soul, from this world."_**


9. What will it profit the sinner who has led an irregular life, to exclaim at death:! that I had
led a life of sanctity! 0! that I had spent my years in loving God! How great is the anguish of a
traveller, who, when the night has fallen, perceives that he has missed the way, and that
there is no more time to correct his mistake! Such shall be the anguish at death of those who
have lived many years in the world, but have not spent them for God. "The night cometh
when no man can work." (John ix. 4.) Hence the Redeemer says to all: **_“Walk whilst you have
light, that the darkness overtake you not."_** (John xii. 35.) Walk in the way of salvation, now
that you have the light, before you are surprised by the darkness of death, in which you can
do nothing. You can then only weep over the time which you have lost.


10. “ **_He hath called against me the time."_** (Thren. i. 15.) At the hour of death, conscience will
remind us of all the time which we have had to become saints, and which we have employed
in multiplying our debts to God. It will remind us of all the calls and of all the graces which
he has given us to make us love him, and which we have abused. At that awful moment we
shall also see that the way of salvation is closed for ever. In the midst of these remorses, and
of the torturing darkness of death, the dying sinner shall say: O fool that I have been! life
misspent! lost years, in which I could have gained treasures of merits, and have become a
saint! but I have neglected both, and now the time of saving my soul is gone for ever. But of
what use shall these wailings and lamentations be, when the scene of this world is about to
close, the lamp is on the point of being extinguished, and when the dying Christian has
arrived at that great moment on which eternity depends?


11. ” **_Be you then also ready; for, at what hour you think not, the Son of Man will come."_**
(Luke xii. 40.; The Lord says: ”Be prepared." He does not tell us to prepare ourselves when
death approaches, but to be ready for his coming; because when we think least of death, the
Son of Man shall come and demand an account of our whole life. In the confusion of death, it



will be most difficult to adjust our accounts, so as to appear guiltless before the tribunal of
Jesus Christ. Perhaps death may not come upon us for twenty or thirty years; but it may also
come very soon, perhaps in a year or in a month. If any one had reason to fear that a trial
should take place, on which his life depended, he certainly would not wait for the day of the
trial, but would as soon as possible employ an advocate to plead his cause. And what do we
do? We know for certain that we must one day be judged, and that on the result of that
judgment our eternal, not our temporal, life depends. We also know that that day may be
very near at hand; and still we lose our time, and, instead of adjusting our accounts, we go on
daily multiplying the crimes which will merit for us the sentence of eternal death.



12. If, then, we have hitherto employed our time in offending God, let us henceforth
endeavour to bewail our misfortune for the remainder of our life, and say continually with
the penitent King Ezechias: ” **_I will recount to thee all my years in the bitterness of my soul."_**
(Isn. xxxviii. 15.) The Lord gives us the remaining days of life, that we may compensate the
time that has been badly spent. **_“Whilst we have time, let us work good."_** (Gal. vi. 10.) Let us
not provoke the Lord to punish us by an unhappy death; and if, during the years that are
passed, we have been foolish, and have offended him, let us now attend to the Apostle
exhorting us to be wise for the future, and to redeem the time we have lost. **_"See, therefore,
brethren, now you walk circumspectly, not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time,
because the days are evil,... understanding what is the will of God. ”_** (Eph. v. 15, 16, 17.) **_"The
days are evil."_** According to St. Anselm, the meaning of these words is, that the days of this
life are evil, because in them we are exposed to a thousand temptations and dangers of
eternal misery; and therefore, to escape perdition, all possible care is necessary. **_"What,"_** says
St. Augustine, **_"is meant by redeeming the time, unless, when necessary, to submit to
temporal loss in order to gain eternal goods ?"_** (de Hom. 50, Hom, i.) We should live only to
fulfil with all diligence the divine will; and, should it be necessary, it is better to suffer in
temporal things, than to neglect our eternal interests. Oh! how well did St. Paul redeem the
time which he had lost! St. Jerome says, that though the last of the apostles, he was, on
account of his great labours, the first in merits. **_"Paul, the last in order, but the first in merits,
because he laboured more than all."_** Let us consider that, in each moment, we may lay up
greater treasures of eternal goods. If the possession of all the land round which you could
walk, or of all the money which you could count in a day, were promised you, would you
lose time? or would you not instantly begin to walk over the ground, or to reckon the money?
You now have it in your power to acquire, in each moment, eternal treasures; and will you,
notwithstanding, misspend your time? Do not say, that what you can do Today you can also
do to-morrow; because this day shall be then lost to you, and shall never return. You have
this day; but perhaps tomorrow will not be given you.


**SERMON XXV. FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. - ON OBEDIENCE TO YOUR
CONFESSOR.**
**_"Whither goest thou ?" JOHN xiii. 16._**


To gain heaven we must walk in the path that leads to Paradise. Many Christians, who have
faith, but not works, live in sin, intent only on the pleasures and goods of this world. If you
say to one of them: you are a Christian; you believe that there is an eternity, a heaven, and a
hell: tell me, do you wish to save your soul? If you do, I will ask you, in the words of this
day’s gospel, **_"whither goest thou?"_** He will answer: I do not know, but I hope to be saved.



You know not whither you are going. How can you hope for salvation from God, if you live
in a state of perdition? How can you expect heaven, if you walk in the way that leads to hell?
It is necessary, then, to change the road; and for this purpose you must put yourself in the
hands of a good confessor, who will point out to you the way to heaven, and you must obey
him punctually. **_"My sheep,"_** said Jesus Christ, **_“hear my voice."_** (John x. 27.) We have not
Jesus Christ on earth to make us sensibly hear his voice; but, in his stead, he has left us his
priests, and has told us, that he who hears them hears him, and he who despises them
despises him. **_"He that heareth you heareth me, and he that despiseth you despiseth me."_**
(Luke x. 16.) Happy they who are obedient to their spiritual father: unhappy they who do not
obey him; for, by their disobedience, they give a proof that they are not among the sheep of
Jesus Christ. I intend this day to show, in the first point, how secure of salvation are all who
obey their confessor; and, in the second point, how great the danger of perdition to which
they who do not obey him are exposed.


**_First Point. How secure of salvation are they who obey their confessor._**



1. In leaving us spiritual fathers to guide us in the way of salvation Jesus Christ has bestowed
upon us a great benefit. To obtain salvation we must follow the will of God in all things.
What, I ask, is necessary in order to save our souls and to become saints? Some imagine that
sanctity consists in performing many works of penance; but were a sick man to perform
mortifications which would expose him to the proximate danger of death, he would, instead
of becoming a saint, be guilty of a very grievous sin. Others think that perfection consists in
long and frequent prayers; but should the father of a family neglect the education of his
children and go into the desert to pray, he, too, would commit sin; because, although prayer
is good, a parent is bound to take care of his children, and he can fulfil the precept of prayer
and attention to their instruction without going into the desert. Others believe that holiness
consists in frequent communion; but if, in spite of a just command of her husband, and to the
injury of her family, a married woman wished to communicate every morning, she would act
improperly, and would have to render an account of her conduct to God. In what, then, does
sanctity consist? It consists in the perfect fulfilment of the will of God. All the sins which
brings souls to hell proceed from self-will; let us, then, says St. Bernard, cease to do our own
will; let us follow the will of God, and for us there shall be no hell. ” **_Cesset propria voluntas,
et infernus non erit."_** (St. Bern. serm. iii., de Resur.)


2. But some of you will ask: How shall we know what God wills us to do? This is a matter
which, ac cording to David, is involved in great doubts and obscurity. **_“Of the business that
walketh about in the dark."_** (Ps. xc. 6.) Many deceive themselves; for passion often makes
them believe that they do the will of God, when, in reality, they do their own will. Let us
thank without ceasing the goodness of Jesus Christ, who has taught us the secure means of
ascertaining the will of God in our regard, by telling us that, if we obey our confessor, we
obey himself. **_“He that heareth you, heareth me."_** In the book of the foundations, chapter x.,
St. Teresa says: "Let a soul take a confessor with a determination to think no more of herself,
but to trust in the words of our Lord: **_“He that heareth you, heareth me."_** She adds, that this is
the secure way of finding the will of God. Hence the saint acknowledged that it was by
obedience to the voice of her director that she attained to the knowledge and love of God.
Hence, speaking of obedience to one’s confessor, St. Francis de Sales adopts the words of
Father M. Avila. **_How much soever you seek, you shall never find the will of God so securely,_**



**_as by this way of humble obedience so much recommended and practised by the ancient
saints._** (Introd., etc., cap. iv.)



3. He that acts according to the advice of his confessor, always pleases God when, through
obedience, he either practises or omits prayer, mortifications, or communions. He even
merits a reward before God when, to obey his confessor, he takes recreation, when he eats or
drinks, because he does the will of God. Hence the Scripture says that” **_much better is
obedience than the victories of fools."_** (Eccl. iv. 17.) Obedience is more pleasing to God than
all the sacrifices of penitential works, or of alms-deeds, which we can offer to him, he that
sacrifices to God his property by alms-deeds, his honour by bearing insults, or his body by
mortifications, by fasts and penitential rigours, offers to him a part of himself and of what
belongs to him; but he that sacrifices to God his will, by obedience, gives to him all that he
has, and can say: **_Lord, having given you my will, I have nothing more to give you._**


4. Thus, obedience to a confessor is the most acceptable offering which we can make to God,
and the most secure way of doing the divine will. Blessed Henry Suson says, that **_God does
not demand an account of what we do through obedience_**. Obey, says the Apostle, your
spiritual fathers; and fear not anything which you do through obedience; for they, and not
you, shall have to render an account of your conduct**_. ”Obey your prelates, and be subject to
them; for they watch, as being to render an account of your souls; that they may do this with
joy and not with grief."_** (Heb. xiii. 17.) Mark the last words: they signify, that penitents
should obey without reply, and without causing pain and sorrow to their confessor. Oh!
what grief do confessors feel when penitents endeavour, by certain pretexts and unjust
complaints, to excuse themselves from obedience! Let us, then, obey our spiritual father
without reply, and let us fear not that we shall have to account for any act which we do
through obedience. ” **_They,"_** says St. Philip Neri, ” **_who desire to advance in the way of God,
should place themselves under a learned confessor, whom they will obey in the place of God.
They who do so may be assured that they shall not have to render to God an account of their
actions."_** Hence, if you practice obedience, and if Jesus Christ should ask you on the day of
judgment why you have chosen such a state of life? why you have communicated so
frequently? why you have omitted certain works of penance? you will answer: **_Lord, I have
done all in obedience to my confessor:_** and Jesus Christ cannot but approve of what you have
done.


5. Father Marchese relates, that St. Dominic once felt a scruple in obeying his confessor, and
that our Lord said to him: **_“Why do you hesitate to obey your director? All that he directs
will be useful to you."_** Hence St. Bernard says, that **_"whatever a man, holding the place of
God commands, provided it be not certainly sinful, should be received as if the command
came from God himself"_** (de Præcep. et Discep., cap. xi.). Gerson relates, that the same St.
Bernard ordered one of his disciples, who, through scruples, was afraid to say Mass, to go,
and trusting in his advice, to offer the holy sacrifices. The disciple obeyed, and was cured of
scruples. Some, adds Gerson, will say: ” **_Would to God that I had a St. Bernard for my
director: my confessor is not a St. Bernard." Whosoever you are that speak in this manner,
you err; for you have not put yourself under the care of man because he is learned, but
because he is placed over you. Obey him, then, not as a man, but as God._** (Tract, de Prsop. ad
Miss.) You have intrusted the care of your soul to a confessor, not because he is a man of



learning, but because God has given him to you as a guide; and, therefore, you ought to obey
him, not as a man, but as God.


6. ” **_An obedient man shall speak of victory_** ." (Prov. xxi. 28.) Justly, says St. Gregory, has the
Wise Man asserted, that they who are obedient shall overcome the temptations of hell:
because, as by their obedience, they subject their own will to men, so they make themselves
superior to the devils, who fell through disobedience. **_"The obedient are conquerors; because,
whilst they subject their will to others, they rule over the angels that have fallen through
disobedience"_** (in lib. Beg., cap. x.) Cassian teaches, that he who mortifies self-will beats down
all vices; because all vices proceed from self-will. **_“By the mortification of the will all vices
are dried up."_** He who obeys his confessor, overcomes all the illusions of the devil, who
sometimes makes us expose ourselves to dangerous occasions under pretext of doing good,
and makes us engage in certain undertakings which appear holy, but which may prove very
injurious to us. Thus, for example, the enemy induces certain devout persons to practise
immoderate austerities, which impair their health; they then give up all mortifications, and
return to their former irregularities. This happens to those who direct themselves; but they
who are guided by their confessor are not in danger of falling into such an illusion.



7. The devil labours to make scrupulous persons afraid that they will commit sin if they
follow the advice of their confessor. We must be careful to overcome these vain fears. All
theologians and spiritual writers commonly teach, **_that it is our duty to obey the directions
of our confessors, and conquer our scruples._** Natalis Alexander says, that we must act against
scruples; and in support of this doctrine, he adduces the doctrine of St. Antonine, who, along
with Gerson, **_censures scrupulous persons for refusing, through vain fears, to obey their
confessor, and to overcome scruples. ”Beware, lest, while you seek security, you rush into a
pit."_** Be careful not, through an excess of fear, to fall into the illusions of the devil, by
disobeying your director. Hence all the spiritual masters exhort us to obey our confessors in
everything which is not manifestly sinful. B. Hubert, of the order of St. Dominic, says that,
” **_unless what is commanded is evidently bad, it ought to be received as if it were commanded
by God"_** (lib. de Erud. llcl., cap. 1). Blessed Denis the Carthusian teaches, that” **_in doubtful
matters we must obey the precept of a superior; because, though it may be against God, a
subject is excused from sin on account of obedience"_** (in 2, dis. xxxix., qu. 3). According to
Gerson (tr. de consc. et scrup.), to act against a conscience formed with deliberation, and to
act against a fear of sinning in some doubtful matter, are very different things. He adds, that
we should banish this fear, and obey our confessor. ” **_Iste timor, quam fieri potest
adjiciendus."_** In a word, he who obeys his spiritual father is always secure. St. Francis de
Sales used to say, that” **_a truly obedient soul has never been lost ;"_** and that we should be
satisfied to know from our confessor that we are going on well in the way of God, without
seeking further certainty of it.


**_Second Point. How great is the danger of perdition to which they who do not obey their
confessor are exposed._**


8. Jesus Christ has said, that he who hears his priest, hears him; and that he who despises
them, despises him. **_"Qui vos spernit, me spernit."_** (Luc. x. 15.) "When the Prophet Eliseus
complained of the contempt which he had received from the people, after God had charged
him with the direction of them, the Lord said to him: ” **_They have not rejected thee, but me,_**



**_that I should not reign over them."_** (1 Kings viii. 7.) They, then, who despise the advice of
their confessors, despise God himself, who has made confessors his own representatives.


9. ” **_Obey your prelates,"_** says St. Paul, **_"and be subject to them; for they watch, as being to
render an account of your souls: that they may do this with joy and not with grief; for, this
is not expedient for you."_** (Heb. xiii. 17.) Some penitents contend with their confessor, and
endeavour to make him adopt their own opinion. This is the cause of grief to spiritual
directors. But the apostle says, ” **_this is not expedient for you ;"_** because, when the confessor
finds that you do not obey him, and that it is only with difficulty he can induce you to walk
in the straight path, he will give up the direction of your soul. How deplorable the condition
of a vessel which a pilot refuses to steer! How miserable the state of a sick man who is
abandoned by his physician! When a patient refuses to obey, or to take the medicine which
has been prescribed when he eats and drinks what he pleases the physician abandons him,
and allows him to follow his own caprice. But, what hope can be entertained of the recovery
of such a patient? **_"Woe to him that is alone, .. .he hath none to lift him up."_** (Eccl. iv. 10.)
Woe to the penitent who wishes to direct himself: he shall have no one to enlighten or correct
him, he will therefore rush into an abyss.



10. To every one that comes into this world the Holy Ghost says: **_"Thou art going in the midst
of snares."_** (Eccl. ix. 20.) We all, on this earth, walk in the midst of a thousand snares; that is,
in the midst of the temptations of the devil, dangerous occasions, bad companions, and our
own passions, which frequently deceive us. Who shall be saved in the midst of so many
dangers? The Wise Man says: **_“He that is aware of the snares shall be secure."_** (Prov. xi. 15.)
They only who avoid these snares shall be saved. How shall we avoid them? If you had to
pass by night through a wood full of precipices, without a guide to give you light, and to
point out to you the dangerous passages, you would certainly run a great risk of losing your
life. You wish to direct yourself: **_"Take heed, therefore, that the light which is in thee be not
darkness."_** (Luke xi. 45.) The light which you think you possess will be your ruin; it will lead
you into a pit.


11. God wills that, in the way of salvation, we all submit to the guidance of our director. Such
has been the practice of even the most learned among the saints. In spiritual things the Lord
wishes us to humble ourselves, and to put ourselves under a confessor, who will be our
guide. Gerson teaches, that **_he who neglects the advice of his director, and directs himself,
does not require a devil to tempt him: he becomes a devil to himself. ”Qui spreto duce, sibi
dux esse vult, non indiget dromone tentante, quia factus est sibi ipse dæmon."_** (Cons, de Lib.
Reg.) And when God sees that he will not obey his minister, he allows him to follow his own
caprice. **_“So I let them go according to the desires of their own hearts."_** (Ps. lxxx. 13.)


12. ” **_It is like the sin of witchcraft to rebel: and like the crime of idolatry to refuse to obey."_**
(1 Kings xv. 23.) In explaining this text, St. Gregory says, that the sin of idolatry consists in
abandoning God and adoring an idol. This a penitent does when he disobeys his confessor to
do his own will: he refuses to do the will of God, who has spoken to him by means of his
minister; he adores the idol of self-will, and does what he pleases. Hence St. John of the Cross
says that, **_"not to follow the advice of our confessor is pride and a want of faith."_** (Tratt.
delle spine, tom, iii., col. 4, 2, n. 8); for it appears to proceed from a want of faith in the
Gospel, in which Jesus Christ has said: **_"He that heareth you, heareth me."_**



### 


13. If, then, you wish to save your souls, obey your confessor punctually. Be careful to have a
fixed confessor, to whom you will ordinarily make your confession; and avoid going about
from one confessor to another. Make choice of a learned priest; and, in the beginning, make
to him a general confession, which, as we know by experience, is a great help to a true change
of life. After having made choice of a confessor, you should not leave him without a just and
manifest cause. ” **_Every time,"_** says St. Teresa, ” **_That I resolved to leave my confessor, I felt
within me a reproof more painful than that which I received from him."_**


**SERMON XXVI. FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER EASTER. - ON THE CONDITIONS OF
PRAYER.**
**_"Ask, and ye shall receive." JOHN xvi. 24._**


IN the thirty-ninth Sermon I shall show the strict necessity of prayer, and its infallible efficacy
to obtain for us all the graces which can be conducive to our eternal salvation. ” **_Prayer,"_** says
St. Cyprian, ” **_is omnipotent; it is one; it can do all things."_** We read in Ecclesiasticus that God
has never refused to hear any one who invoked his aid. ” **_Who hath called upon him, and he
hath despised him?"_** (Eccl. ii. 12.) This he never can do; for he has promised to hear all who
pray to him. ” **_Ask, and ye shall receive."_** But this promise extends only to prayer which has
the necessary conditions. Many pray; but because they pray negligently, they do not obtain
the graces they deserve. ” **_You ask, and receive not, because you ask amiss."_** (St. James iv. 3.)
To pray as we ought, we must pray, first, with humility; secondly, with confidence; and
thirdly, with perseverance.


**_First Point. "We must pray with humility._**


1. St. James tells us, that God rejects the prayers of the proud: **_"God resisteth the proud, and
giveth grace to the humble"_** (iv. 6). He cannot bear the proud; he rejects their petitions, and
refuses to hear them. Let those proud Christians who trust in their own strength, and think
themselves better than others, attend to this, and let them remember that their prayers shall
be rejected by the Lord.


2. But He always hears the prayers of the humble: **_"The prayer of him that humbleth himself
pierceth the clouds; and he will not depart till the Most High behold."_** (Eccl. xxxv. 21.) David
says, that "The Lord hath had regard to the prayer of the humble." (Ps. ci. 18.) The cry of the
humble man penetrates the heavens, and he will not depart till God hears his prayer. **_"You
humble yourself,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_and God comes to you; you exalt yourself, and he flies
from you."_** If you humble yourself, God himself comes, of his own accord, to embrace you;
but, if you exalt yourself, and boast of your wisdom and of your actions, he withdraws from
you, and abandons you to your own nothingness.


3. The Lord cannot despise even the most obdurate sinners, when they repent from their
hearts, and humble themselves before him, acknowledging that they are unworthy to receive
any favour from him. ” **_A contrite and humble heart, God, thou wilt not despise."_** (Ps. l, 19.)
Let us pass to the other points, in which there is a great deal to be said.


**_Second Point. We must pray with confidence._**





4. **_“No one hath hoped in the Lord, and hath been confounded."_** (Eccl. ii. 11.) Oh! how
encouraging to sinners are these words! Though they may have committed the most
enormous crimes, they are told by the Holy Ghost, that” **_no man hath hoped in the Lord, and
hath been confounded."_** No man hath ever placed his trust in God, and has been abandoned.
He that prays with confidence obtains whatever he asks. **_“All things whatsoever you ask
when you pray, believe that you shall receive, and they shall come unto you."_** (Mark xi. 24.)
When we pray for spiritual favours, let us have a secure confidence of receiving them, and
we shall infallibly obtain them**_. Hence the Saviour has taught us to call God, in our petitions
for his graces, by no other name than that of Father ( Our Father), that we may have recourse
to him with the confidence with which a child seeks assistance from an affectionate parent._**


5. Who, says St. Augustine, can fear that Jesus Christ, who is truth itself, can violate his
promise to all who pray to him? **_"Who shall fear deception when truth promises?"_** Is God
like men, who promise, and do not afterwards fulfil their promise, either because in making
it they intend to deceive, or because, after having made it, they change their intention? **_“God
is not as a man, that he should lie, nor as the son of man, that he should be changed. Hath he
told, then, and will he not do?"_** (Num. xxiii. 19.) Our God cannot tell a lie; because he is truth
itself: he is not liable to change; because all his arrangements are just and holy.


6. And because he ardently desires our welfare, he earnestly exhausts and commands us to
ask the graces we stand in need of. ” **_Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find;
knock, and it shall be opened to you."_** (Matt. vii. 7.) Why, says St. Augustine, should the Lord
exhort us so strongly to ask his graces, if he did not wish to give them to us? **_"Non nos
hortaretur, ut peteremus, nisi dare vellet"_** (de Verb. Dom., ser. v.) He has even bound himself
by his promise to hear our prayers, and to bestow upon us all the graces which we ask with a
confidence of obtaining them. **_“By his promises he has made himself a debtor."_** (S. Augus.,
ibid., ser. ii.)


7. But some will say: I have but little confidence in God, because I am a sinner. I have been
too ungrateful to him, and therefore I see that I do not deserve to be heard. But St. Thomas
tells us, **_that the efficacy of our prayers in obtaining graces from God, does not depend on our
merits, but on the divine mercy. "Oratio in impetrando non innititur nostris mentis, sed soli
divinæ misericordiæ"_** (2, 2, qu. 178, a. 2, ad. 1.) As often as we ask with confidence favours
which are conducive to our eternal salvation, God hears our prayer. I have said, **_“favours
conducive to our salvation ;"_** for, if what we seek be injurious to the soul, God does not, and
cannot hear us. For example: if a person asked help from God to be revenged of an enemy, or
to accomplish what would be offensive to God, the Lord will not hear his prayers; because,
says St. Chrysostom, **_such a person offends God in the very act of prayer; he does not pray,
but, in a certain manner mocks God_**. ” **_Qui orat et peccat, non rogat Deum, sed eludit."_** (Hom,
xi., in Matt, vi.)


8. Moreover, if you wish to receive from God the aid which you ask, you must remove every
obstacle which may render you unworthy of being heard. For example: if you ask of God
strength to preserve you from relapsing into a certain sin, but will not avoid the occasions of
the sin, nor keep at a distance from the house, from the object, or the bad company, which led
to your fall, God will not hear your prayer. And why? Because **_“thou hast set a cloud before
thee, that prayer may not pass through. ”_** (Thren. iii. 44.) Should you relapse, do not



complain of God, nor say: I have besought the Lord to preserve me from falling into sin, but
he has not heard me. Do you not see that, by not taking away the occasions of sin, you have
interposed a thick cloud, which has prevented your prayers from passing to the throne of
divine mercy.



9. It is also necessary to remark that the promise of Jesus Christ to hear those who pray to
him does not extend to all the temporal favours which we ask such as a plentiful harvest, a
victory in a law-suit, or a deliverance from sickness, or from certain persecutions. These
favours God grants to those who pray for them; but only when they are conducive to their
spiritual welfare. Otherwise he refuses them; and he refuses them because he loves us, and
because he knows that they would be injurious to our souls. **_“A physician,"_** says St.
Augustine, **_"knows better than his patient what is useful for him"_** (tom. 3, cap. ccxii). The
saint adds that God refuses to some, through mercy, what he grants to others as a
chastisement. **_“Deus negat propitius, quæ concedit iratus."_** Hence St. John Damascene says
that **_sometimes, when we do not obtain the graces which we ask, we receive, by not receiving
them; because it is better for us not to receive than to receive them. “Etiam si non accipias,
non accipendo accepisti, interdum enim non accipere quam accipendo satius est."_** (Paral, lib.
3, cap. xv.) We often ask poison which would cause our death. How many are there who, had
they died in the sickness or poverty with which they had been afflicted, should be saved? But
because they recovered their health, or because they were raised to wealth and honours, they
became proud and forgot God, and thus have heen damned. Hence St. Chrysostom exhorts
us to ask in our prayers what he knows to be expedient for us. **_"Orantes in ejus potestate
ponamus, ut nos illud petentes exaudiat, quod ipse nobis expendire cognoscit."_** (Hom. xv. in
Matt.) We should, then, always ask from God temporal favours on the condition that they
will be useful to the soul.


10. But spiritual favours, such as the pardon of our sins, perseverance in virtue, the gift of
divine love, and resignation to the divine will, ought to be asked of God absolutely, and with
a firm confidence of obtaining them. **_"If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to
your children, how much more will your Father from Heaven give the good Spirit to them
that ask him?"_** (Luke xi. 13.) If you, says Jesus Christ, who are so much attached to earthly
goods, cannot refuse your children the blessings which you have received from God, how
much more will your Heavenly Father (who is in himself infinitely good, and who desires to
give you his graces more ardently than you desire to receive them) give the good spirit that
is, a sincere contrition for their sins, the gift of divine love, and resignation to the will of God
to those who ask them? **_"Quando Deus negabit,"_** says St. Bernard, **_"potentibus qui etiam non
potentes hortatur ut petant?"_** (Ser. ii. de S. Andr.) How can God refuse graces conducive to
salvation to those who seek them, when he exhorts even those who do not pray to ask them?


11. Nor does God inquire whether the person who prays to him is a just man or a sinner; for
he has declared that **_”every one that asketh, receiveth."_** (Luke xi. 10.)” **_Every one,"_** says the
author of the **_Imperfect Work, ”whether he be a just man or a sinner."_** (Hom, xviii.) And, to
encourage us to pray and to ask with confidence for spiritual favours, he has said: ” **_Amen,
amen, I say to you: If you ask the Father anything in my name, he will give it you."_** (John xvi.
23.) As if he said: Sinners, though you do not deserve to receive the divine graces, I have
merited them for you from my Father: ask, then, in my name that is, through my merits and I
promise that you shall obtain whatsoever you demand.



### 


**_Third Point. "We must pray with perseverance._**



12. It is, above all, necessary to persevere in prayer till death, and never to cease to pray. This
is what is inculcated by the following passages of Scripture: **_“We ought always to pray."_**
(Luke xviii. 1.) **_"Watch ye, therefore, praying at all times”_** (xxi. 36). **_"Pray without ceasing_**. ”
(I Thess. v. 17.) Hence the Holy Ghost says: "Let nothing hinder thee from praying always."
(Eccl. xviii. 22.) These words imply, not only that we should pray always, but also that we
should endeavour to remove every occasion which may prevent us from praying; for, if we
cease to pray, we shall be deprived of the divine aid, and shall be overcome by temptations.
**_Perseverance in grace is a gratuitous gift, which, as the Council of Trent has declared, we
cannot merit_** (Ses. 6, cap. xiii.); but St. Augustine says, that **_we may obtain it by prayer. ”Hoc
donum Dei suppliciter emereri, potest id est supplicando impetrari."_** (de Dono. Per., cap. vi.)
Hence Cardinal Bellarmine teaches that **_“we must ask it daily, in order to obtain it
everyday."_** If we neglect to ask it on any day, we may fall into sin on that day.


13. If, then, we wish to persevere and to be saved for no one can be saved without
perseverance we must pray continually. Our perseverance depends, not on one grace, but on
a thousand helps which we hope to obtain from God during our whole lives, that we may be
preserved in his grace. Now, to this chain of graces a chain of prayers on our part must
correspond; without these prayers, God ordinarily does not grant his graces. If we neglect to
pray, and thus break the chain of prayers, the chain of graces shall also be broken, and we
shall lose the grace of perseverance. If, says Jesus Christ to his disciples, one of you go during
the night to a friend, and say to him: Lend me three loaves; an acquaintance has come to my
house, and I have no refreshment for him. The friend will answer: I am in bed; the door is
locked; I cannot get up. But, if the other continue to knock at the door, and will not depart,
the friend will rise, and give him as many loaves as he wishes, not through friendship, but to
be freed from his importunity. **_“Although he will not rise and give him because he is his
friend; yet, because of his importunity, he will rise, and give him as many as he needeth."_**
(Luke xi. 8.) Now, if a man will give his loaves to a friend because of his importunity, ”how
much more," says St. Augustine, **_“will God give, who exhorts us to ask, and is displeased if
we do not ask ?"_** How much more will the Lord bestow on us his graces, if we persevere in
praying for them, when he exhorts us to ask them, and is offended if we do not ask them?


14. Men feel annoyed at being frequently and importunately asked for a favour. But God
exhorts us to pray frequently; and, instead of being dissatisfied, he is pleased with those who
repeatedly ask his graces. Cornelius à Lapide says, that **_“God wishes us to persevere in
prayer, even to importunity."_** (in Luc., cap. xi.) St. Jerome says: **_"This importunity with the
Lord is seasonable."_** (in Luc. xi.) That God is pleased with frequent and persevering prayer,
may be inferred from the words of Jesus Christ: **_"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and
you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you."_** (Luke xi. 9.) It was not enough to have
said **_ask_** but he added, **_seek, knock;_** in order to show, that, during our whole lives, we should
be as importunate in supplicating the divine graces as beggars are in asking alms. Though
they should be refused, they do not cease to cry out, or to knock at the door; they persist in
asking relief till they obtain it.





15. If, then, we wish to obtain from God the gift of perseverance, we must ask it from him
continually and with importunity. We must ask it when we rise in the morning, in our
meditations, in hearing Mass, in our visits to the blessed sacrament, in going to bed at night,
and particularly when we are tempted by the devil to commit any sin. Thus, we must always
have our mouths open praying to God, and saying: Lord, assist me; give me light; give me
strength; keep thy hand upon me, and do not abandon me. We must do violence to the Lord.
**_“Such violence,"_** says Tertullian, ” **_is agreeable to God."_** The violence which we offer to God
by repeated prayers does not offend him: on the contrary, it is pleasing and acceptable in his
sight. **_"Prayer,"_** according to St. John Climacus, **_"piously offers violence to God."_** Our
supplications compel him, but in a manner grateful to him. He takes great complacency in
seeing his mother honoured, and therefore wishes, as St. Bernard says, that all the graces we
receive should pass through her hands. Hence the holy doctor exhorts us **_"to seek grace, and
to seek it through Mary, because she is a mother, and her prayer cannot be fruitless."_** (de
Aquæd.) When we ask her to obtain any grace for us, she graciously hears our petitions and
prays for us: and the prayers of Mary are never rejected.


**SERMON XXVII. SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST, OR THE SUNDAY WITHIN
THE OCTAVE OF THE ASCENSION. - ON HUMAN RESPECT.**
**_“Whosoever killeth you, will think that he doeth a service to God." JOHN xvi. 2._**


IN exhorting his disciples to be faithful to him under the persecution which they were to
endure, the Saviour said: **_“Yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that
he doeth a service to God."_** Thus, the enemies of the faith believed that in putting Christians
to death they did a service to God. It is thus that many Christians of the present day act. They
kill their own souls by losing the grace of God through human respect and to please worldly
friends. Oh! how many souls has human respect that great enemy of our salvation sent to
hell! I shall speak on this subject today, that, if you wish to serve God and save your souls,
you may guard as much as possible against human respect. In the first point, I will show the
importance of not being influenced by human respect; and in the second, I will point out the
means by which this vice may be overcome.


**_First Point On the importance of not being influenced by human respect._**


1. **_"Woe to the world because of scandals."_** (Matt, xviii. 7.) Jesus Christ has said, that through
the scandals of the wicked, many souls fall into hell. But how is it possible to live in the midst
of the world, and not to take scandal? This is impossible. To avoid taking scandal, St. Paul
says, we should leave this world. **_"Otherwise you must needs go out of this world."_** ( I Cor. v.
10.) But it is in our power to avoid familiarity with scandalous sinners. Hence the Apostle
adds: **_"But now I have written to you not to keep company .... with such an one, not as much
as to eat."_** (Ibid. v. 11.) We should beware of contracting intimacy with such sinners; for,
should we be united with them in the bonds of friendship, we shall feel an unwillingness to
oppose their bad practices and bad counsels. Thus, through human respect and the fear of
contradicting them, we will imitate their example, and lose the friendship of God.


2. Such lovers of the world not only glory in their own iniquities. **_"They rejoice in most
wicked things."_** (Prov. ii. 14); but, what is worse, they wish to have companions, and ridicule
all who endeavour to live like true Christians and to avoid the dangers of offending God.



This is a sin which is very displeasing to God, and which he forbids in a particular manner.
**_"Despise not a man that turneth away from sin, nor reproach him therewith."_** (Eccl. viii. 6.)
Despise not those who keep at a distance from sin, and seek not to draw them to evil by your
reproaches and irregularities. The Lord declares, that, for those who throw ridicule on the
virtuous, chastisements are prepared in this and in the next life. **_"Judgments are prepared for
scorners, and striking hammers for the bodies of fools."_** (Prov. xix. 29.) They mock the
servants of God, and he shall mock them for all eternity. **_"But the Lord shall laugh them to
scorn. And they shall fall after this without honour, and be a reproach among the dead
forever."_** (Wis. iv. 18.) They endeavour to make the saints contemptible in the eyes of the
world, and God shall make them die without honour, and shall send them to hell to suffer
eternal ignominy among the damned.



3. Not only to offend God, but also to endeavour to make others offend him, is truly an
enormous excess of wickedness. This execrable intention arises from a conviction that there
are many weak and pusillanimous souls, who, to escape derision and contempt, abandon the
practice of virtue, and give themselves up to a life of sin. After his conversion to God, St.
Augustine wept for having associated with those ministers of Lucifer, and confessed, that he
felt ashamed not to be as wicked and as shameless as they were. **_"Pudebat me”_** says the saint,
**_"esse pudentem."_** How many, to avoid the scoffs of wicked friends, have been induced to
imitate their wickedness! **_”Behold the saint”_** these impious scoffers will say;” **_get me a piece of
his garment; I will preserve it as a relic. Why does he not become a monk ?"_** How many also
when they receive an insult, resolve to take revenge, not so much through passion, as to
escape the reputation of being cowards! How many are there who, after having inadvertently
given expression to a scandalous maxim, neglect to retract it (as they are bound to do),
through fear of losing the esteem of others! How many, because they are afraid of forfeiting
the favour of a friend, sell their souls to the devil! They imitate the conduct of Pilate, who,
through the apprehension of losing the friendship of Caesar, condemned Jesus Christ to
death.


4. Be attentive. Brethren, if we wish to save our souls, we must overcome human respect, and
bear the little confusion which may arise from the scoffs of the enemies of the cross of Jesus
Christ. **_"For there is a shame that bringeth sin, and there is a shame that bringeth glory and
grace."_** (Eccl. iv. 25.) If we do not suffer this confusion with patience, it will lead us into the
pit of sin; but if we submit to it for God’s sake, it will obtain for us the divine grace here, and
great glory hereafter. **_"As,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_bashfulness is laudable in evil, so it is
reprehensible in good."_** (Hom. x. in Ezech.)


5. But some of you will say: I attend to my own affairs; I wish to save my soul; why then
should I be persecuted? But there is no remedy; it is impossible to serve God, and not be
persecuted. **_“The wicked loathe them that are in the right way."_** (Prov. xxix. 27.) Sinners
cannot bear the sight of the man who lives according to the Gospel, because his life is a
continual censure on their disorderly conduct; and therefore they say: **_"Let us lie in wait for
the just; because he is not for our turn, and he is contrary to our doings, and upbraideth us
with transgressions of the law. ”_** (Wis. ii. 12.) The proud man, who seeks revenge for every
insult which he receives, would wish that all should avenge the offences that may be offered
to him. The avaricious, who grow rich by injustice, wish that all should imitate their
fraudulent practices. The drunkard wishes to see others indulge like himself in intoxication.



The immoral, who boast of their impurities, and can scarcely utter a word which does not
savour of obscenity, desire that all should act and speak as they do; and those who do not
imitate their conduct, they regard as mean, clownish, and intractable as men without honour
and education. **_"They are of the world, therefore of the world they speak. ”_** (1 John iv. 5.)
Worldlings can speak no other language than that of the world. Oh! how great is their
poverty and blindness! She has blinded them, and therefore they speak so profanely. **_“These
things they thought, and were deceived; for their own malice blinded them."_** (Wis. ii. 21.)



6. But I say again, that there is no remedy. All, as St. Paul says, who wish to live in union
with Jesus Christ must be persecuted by the world. **_"And all that will live godly in Christ,
shall suffer persecution."_** (2 Tim. iii. 12.) All the saints have been persecuted. You say: I do
not injure any one; why then am I not left in peace? What evil have the saints, and
particularly the martyrs, done? They were full of charity; they loved all, and laboured to do
good to all; and how have they been treated by the world? They have been flayed alive; they
have been tortured with red-hot plates of iron; and have been put to death in the most cruel
manner. And whom has Jesus Christ the saint of saints injured? He consoled all; he healed
all. **_“Virtue went out from him, and healed all."_** (Luke vi. 19.) And how has the world treated
him? It has persecuted him, so as to make him die through pain on the infamous gibbet of the
cross.


7. This happens because the maxims of the world are diametrically opposed to the maxims of
Jesus Christ. What the world esteems, Jesus Christ regards as folly. **_"For the wisdom of this
world is foolishness with God_** ." (1 Cor. iii. 19.) And what is foolish in the eyes of the world
that is, crosses, sickness, contempt, and ignominies Jesus Christ holds in great estimation.
**_"For the Word of the cross, to them indeed that perish, is foolishness."_** (1 Cor. i. 18.) How,
says St. Cyprian, can a man think himself to be a Christian, when he is afraid to be a
Christian?” **_Christianum se putat si Christianum esse veretur”_** (Ser. v. de Lapsis.) If we are
Christians, let us show that we are Christians in name and in truth; for, if we are ashamed of
Jesus Christ, he will be ashamed of us, and cannot give us a place on his right hand on the
last day. **_“For he that shall be ashamed of me and my words, of him the Son of Man shall be
ashamed when he shall come in his majesty."_** (Luke ix. 2 6 .) On the day of judgment he shall
say: You have been ashamed of me on earth: I am now ashamed to see you with me in
Paradise. Begone, accursed souls; go into hell to meet your companions, who have been
ashamed of me. But mark the words **_“he that shall be ashamed of me and of my words."_** St.
Augustine says, **_that some are ashamed to deny Jesus Christ, but do not blush to deny the
maxims of Jesus Christ. ”Erubescunt negare Christum, et non erubescunt negare verba
Christi."_** (Serm. xlviii.) But you may tell me, that, if you say you cannot do such an act,
because it is contrary to the Gospel, your friends will turn you into ridicule, and will call you
a hypocrite. Then, says St. John Chrysostom, **_you will not suffer to be treated with derision
by a companion, and you are content to be hated by God! “Non vis a conserve derideri, sed
odio haberi a Deo tuo ?"_** (Hom. xci. in Act. xix.)


8. The Apostle, who gloried in being a follower of Christ, said: **_"The world is crucified to me,
and I to the world."_** (Gal. vi. 14.) As I am a person crucified to the world an object of its scoffs
and injustice, so the world is to me an object of contempt and abomination. It is necessary to
be convinced, that if we do not trample on the world, the world will trample on our souls.
But what is the world and all its goods? **_“All that is in the world is the concupiscence of the_**



**_flesh, and the concupiscence of the eyes, and the pride of life."_** (1 John ii. 16.) To what are all
the goods of this earth reduced? To riches, which are but dung; to honours, which are only
smoke; and to carnal pleasures. But what shall all these profit us, if we lose our souls? **_“What
doth it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his soul ?"_** (Matt. xvi.
26.)



9. He that loves God and wishes to save his soul must despise the world and all human
respect; and to do this, everyone must offer violence to himself. St. Mary Magdalene had to
do great violence to herself, in order to overcome human respect and the murmurings and
scoffs of the world, when, in the presence of so many persons, she cast herself at the feet of
Jesus Christ, to wash them with her tears, and dry them with her hair. But she thus became a
saint, and merited from Jesus Christ pardon of her sins, and praise for her great love. ” **_Many
sins are forgiven her because she hath loved much."_** (Luke vii. 47.) One day, as St. Francis
Borgia carried to certain prisoners a vessel of broth under his cloak, he met his son mounted
on a fine horse, and accompanied by certain noblemen. The saint felt ashamed to show what
he carried under his cloak. But what did he do in order to conquer human respect? **_He took
the vessel of broth, placed it on his head, and thus showed his contempt for the world. Jesus
Christ, our Head and Master, when nailed to the cross, was mocked by the soldiers. ”If thou
be the Son of God, come down from the cross."_** (Matt, xxvii. 40.) He was mocked by the
priests, saying: ” **_He saved others; himself he cannot save."_** (Ibid., v. 42.) But he remained firm
on the cross; he cheerfully died upon it, and thus conquered the world.


10. ” **_I give thanks to God,"_** says St. Jerome, **_“that I am worthy to be hated by the world."_**
(Epis. ad Asellam.) The saint returns thanks to God for having made him worthy of the
hatred of the world. Jesus Christ pronounced his disciples blessed when they should be hated
by men. ” **_Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you."_** (Luke vi. 22.) Christians, let us
rejoice; for, if worldlings curse and upbraid us, God at the same time praises and blesses us.
**_"They will curse, and thou wilt bless."_** (Ps. cviii. 28.) Is it not enough for us to be praised by
God, to be praised by the queen of heaven, by all the angels, by all the saints, and by all just
men? Let worldlings say what they wish; but let us continue to please God, who will give us,
in the next life, a reward proportioned to the violence we shall have done to ourselves in
despising the contradictions of men. Each of you should figure to himself, that there is no one
in the world but himself and God. When the wicked treat us with contempt, let us
recommend to God these blind and miserable men, who run in the road to perdition; and let
us thank the Lord for giving to us the light which he refuses to them. Let us continue in our
own way: to obtain all, it is necessary to conquer all.


**_Second Point. On the means of overcoming human respect._**


11. To overcome human respect, it is necessary to fix in our hearts the holy resolution of
preferring the grace of God to all the goods and favours of this world, and to say with St.
Paul: **_"Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers,... .nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God."_** (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) Jesus Christ
exhorts us not to be afraid of those who can take away the life of the body; but to fear him
only who can condemn the soul and body to hell. **_“And fear you not them that kill the body;
but rather fear him that can destroy both soul and body into hell."_** (Matt, x. 28.) We wish
either to follow God or the world; if we wish to follow God we must give up the world. **_"how_**



**_long do you halt between two sides ?"_** said Elias to the people. ” **_If the Lord be God, follow
him."_** (3 Kings xviii. 21.) You cannot serve God and the world. He that seeks to please men
cannot please God. ” **_If,"_** says the Apostle, **_"I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of
Christ. ”_** (Gal. i. 10.)



12. The true servants of God rejoice to see themselves despised and maltreated for the sake of
Jesus Christ. The holy apostles **_“went from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they
were accounted worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus."_** (Acts v. 41.) Moses could
have prevented the anger of Pharaoh by not contradicting the current report that he was the
son of Pharaoh’s daughter. But he denied that he was her son, preferring, as St. Paul says, the
opprobrium of Christ to all the riches of the world. “ **_Choosing rather to be afflicted with the
people of God;. .. .esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasure of the
Egyptians."_** (Heb. xi. 25, 26.)


13. Wicked friends come to you and say: What extravagances are those in which you
indulge? Why do you not act like others? Say to them in answer: My conduct is not opposed
to that of all men; there are others who lead a holy life. They are indeed few; but I will follow
their example; for the Gospel says: **_"Many are called, but few are chosen."_** (Matt. xx. 16.) **_"If,"_**
says St. John Climacus, **_“you wish to be saved with the few, live like the few_**. **_"_** But, they will
add, do you not see that all murmur against you, and condemn your manner of living? Let
your answer be: It is enough for me that God does not censure my conduct. **_Is it not better to
obey God than to obey men?_** Such was the answer of St. Peter and St. John to the Jewish
priests: **_“If it be just in the sight of God to hear you rather than God, judge ye."_** (Acts iv. 19.)
If they ask you how can you bear an insult? or how, after submitting to it, can you appear
among your equals? answer them by saying that you are a Christian, and that it is enough for
you to appear well in the eyes of God. Such should be your answer to all those satellites of
Satan: you must despise all their maxims and reproaches. And when it is necessary to
reprove those who make little of God’s law, you must take courage and correct them
publicly. **_“Them that sin, reprove before all."_** (1 Tim. v. 20.) And when there is question of the
divine honour, we should not be frightened by the dignity of the man who offends God; let
us say to him openly: This is sinful; it cannot be done. Let us imitate the Baptist, who
reproved King Herod for living with his brothers wife, and said to him: **_"It is not lawful for
thee to have her."_** (Matt. xiv. 4.) Men indeed shall regard us as fools, and turn us into
derision; but, on the day of judgment they shall acknowledge that they have been foolish,
and we shall have the glory of being numbered among the saints. They shall say: **_“These are
they whom we had sometime in derision. .. .We fools esteemed their life madness, and their
end without honour. Behold how they are numbered among the children of God, and their lot
is among the saints."_** (Wis. v. 3, 4, 5.)


**SERMON XXVIII. PENTECOST SUNDAY. - ON CONFORMITY TO THE WILL OF
GOD.**
**_"As the Father hath given me commandment, so do I." JOHN xiv. 31._**


JESUS CHRIST was given to us, by God, as a saviour and as a master. Hence he came on
earth principally to teach us, not only by his words but also by his own example, how we are
to love God our supreme good: hence, as we read in this days Gospel, he said to his disciples:
**_"That the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father hath given me_**



**_commandment, so do I."_** To show the world the love I bear to the Father, I will execute all his
commands. In another place he said: ”I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but
the will of him that sent me." (John vi. 38.) Devout souls, if you love God and desire to
become saints, you must seek his will, and wish what he wishes. St. Paul tells us, that the
divine love is poured into our souls by means of the Holy Ghost. **_“The charity of God is
poured into our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us."_** (Hom. v. 5.) If, then, we wish
for the gift of divine love, we must constantly beseech the Holy Ghost to make us know and
do the will of God. Let us continually implore his light to know, and his strength to fulfil the
divine will. Many wish to love God, but they, at the same time, wish to follow their own, and
not his will. Hence I shall show today, in the first point, that uur sanctification consists
entirely in conformity to the will of God; and in the second, I shall show how, and in what,
we should in practice conform ourselves to the divine will.


**_First Point Our sanctification consists entirely in conformity to the will of God._**



1. It is certain that our salvation consists in loving God. A soul that does not love God is not
living, but dead. **_"He that loveth not, abideth in death."_** (1 John iii. 14.) The perfection of love
consists in conforming our will to the will of God. **_"And life in his good will."_** (Ps. xxix.
6.)”Have charity, which is the bond of perfection." (Col. iii. 14.) According to the Areopagite,
the principal effect of love is to unite the wills of lovers, so that they may have but one heart
and one will. Hence all our works, communions, prayers, penances, and alms, please God in
proportion to their conformity to the divine will; and if they be contrary to the will of God,
they are no longer acts of virtue, but defects deserving chastisement.


2. Whilst preaching one day, Jesus Christ was told that his mother and brethren were waiting
for him; in answer he said: **_"Whosoever shall do the will of my Father that is in heaven, he is
my brother and sister and mother."_** (Matt. xii. 50.) By these words he gave us to understand
that he acknowledged as friends and relatives those only who fulfil the will of his Father.


3. The saints in heaven love God perfectly. In what, I ask, does the perfection of their love
consist? It consists in an entire conformity to the divine will. Hence Jesus Christ has taught us
to pray for grace to do the will of God on earth, as the saints do it in heaven. ” **_Thy will be
done on earth, as it is in heaven."_** (Matt. vi. 10.) Hence St. Teresa says, that”they who practise
prayer, should seek in all things to conform their will to the will of God." In this, she adds,
consists the highest perfection. He that practises it in the most perfect manner, shall receive
from God the greatest gifts, and shall make the greatest progress in interior life. The
accomplishment of the divine will has been the sole end of the saints in the practice of all
virtues. Blessed Henry Suson used to say: **_"I would rather be the vilest man on earth with the
will of God, than be a seraph with my own will."_**


4. A perfect act of conformity is sufficient to make a person a saint. Behold, Jesus Christ
appeared to St. Paul while he was persecuting the Church, and converted him. What did the
saint do? He did nothing more than offer to God his will, that he might dispose of it as he
pleased. **_"Lord,"_** he exclaimed, **_“what wilt thou have me to do?_** (Acts ix. 6.) And instantly
the Lord declared to Ananias, that Saul was a vessel of election, and apostle of the Gentiles.
**_“This man is a vessel of election to carry my name before the Gentiles."_** (Acts ix. 15.) He that
gives his will to God, gives him all he has. He that mortifies himself by fasts and penitential



austerities, or that gives alms to the poor for God’s sake, gives to God a part of himself and of
his goods; but he that gives his will to God, gives him all, and can say: Lord, having given
thee my will, I have nothing more to give thee I have given thee all. It is our heart that is, our
will that God asks of us. **_“My son, give me thy heart."_** (Prov. xxiii. 26.) Since, then, says the
holy Abbot Nilus, our will is so acceptable to God, we ought, in our prayers, to ask of him the
grace, not that we may do what he will, but that we may do all that he wishes us to do. Every
one knows this truth, that our sanctification consists in doing the will of God; but there is
some difficulty in reducing it to practice. Let us, then, come to the second point, in which I
have to say many things of great practical utility.


**_Second Point How, and in what, we ought to practise conformity to the will of God._**



5. That we may feel a facility of doing on all occasions the divine will, we must beforehand
offer ourselves continually to embrace in peace whatever God ordains or wills. Such was the
practice of holy David. **_“My heart,"_** he used to say, ” **_is ready; God! my heart is ready."_** (Ps.
cvii. 2.) And he continually besought the Lord to teach him to do his divine will. ” **_Teach me
to do thy will."_** (Ps. cxlii. 1 0.) He thus deserved to be called a man according to God’s own
heart. ” **_I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to my own heart, who shall do
all my wills."_** (Acts xiii. 2 2.) And why? Because the holy king was always ready to do
whatever God wished him to do.


6. St. Teresa offered herself to God fifty times in the day, that he might dispose of her as he
pleased, and declared her readiness to emhrace either prosperity or adversity. The perfection
of our oblation consists in our offering ourselves to God without reserve. All are prepared to
unite themselves to the divine will in prosperity; but perfection consists in conforming to it,
even in adversity. To thank God in all things that are agreeable to us, is acceptable to him; but
to accept with cheerfulness what is repugnant to our inclinations, is still more pleasing to
him. Father M. Avila used to say, that **_"a single blessed be God, in adversity, is better than
six thousand thanksgivings in prosperity."_**


7. We should conform to the divine will, not only in misfortunes which come directly from
God such as sickness, loss of property, privation of friends and relatives but also in crosses
which come to us from men, but indirectly from God such as acts of injustice, defamations,
calumnies, injuries, and all other sorts of persecutions. But, you may ask, does God will that
others commit sin, by injuring us in our property or in our reputation? No; God wills not
their sin; but he wishes us to bear with such a loss and with such a humiliation; and he
wishes us to conform, on all such occasions, to his divine will.


8. **_"Good things and evil... are from God."_** (Eccl. xi. 14.) All blessings such as riches and
honours and all misfortunes such as sickness and persecutions come from God. But mark
that the Scripture calls them evils, only because we, through the want of conformity to the
will of God, regard them as evils and misfortunes. But, in reality, if we accepted them from
the hands of God with Christian resignation, they should be blessings and not evils. The
jewels which give the greatest splendour to the crown of the saints in heaven, are the
tribulations which they bore with patience, as coming from the hands of the Lord. On
hearing that the Sabeans had taken away all his oxen and asses, holy Job said: **_“The Lord
gave, and the Lord hath taken away."_** (Job i. 21.) He did not say that the Lord gave, and that



the Sabeans had taken away; but that the Lord gave, and that the Lord had taken away: and
therefore he blessed the Lord, believing that all had happened through the divine will. **_“As it
has pleased the Lord, so it is done: blessed be the name of the Lord."_** (Ibid.) Being tormented
with iron hooks and burning torches, the holy martyrs Epictetus and Atone said: ” **_Lord, thy
will be done in us." And their last words were: ”Be blessed, eternal God, for having given us
the grace to accomplish thy will."_**


9. ” **_Whatsoever shall befall the just man, it shall not make him sad."_** (Prov. xii. 21.) A soul
that loves God is not disturbed by any misfortune that may happen to her. Cesarius relates
(lib. x., c. vi.), that a certain monk who did not perform greater austerities than his
companions, wrought many miracles. Being astonished at this, the abbot asked him one day
what were the works of piety which he practised. **_He answered, that he was more imperfect
than the other monks; but that his sole concern was to conform himself to the divine will.
Were you displeased, said the abbot, with the person who injured us so grievously a few
days ago? No, father, replied the monk; I, on the contrary, thanked God for it; because I
know that he does or permits all things for our good. From this answer the abbot perceived
the sanctity of the good religious._** We should act in a similar manner under all the crosses
that come upon us. Let us always say: ” **_Yea, Father; for so hath it seemed good in thy sight."_**
(Matt. xi. 26.) Lord, this is pleasing to thee, let it be done.



10. He that acts in this manner enjoys that peace which the angels announced at the birth of
Jesus Christ to men of good will that is, to those whose wills are united to the will of God.
These, as the Apostle says, enjoy that peace which exceeds all sensual delights. “ **_The peace of
God, which surpasseth all understanding."_** (Phil. iv. 7.) A great and solid peace, which is not
liable to change. **_"A holy man continueth in wisdom like the sun; but a fool is changing like
the moon."_** ( **_Eccl_**. xxvii 12.) Fools that is, sinners are changed like the moon, which increases
today, and grows less on tomorrow; Today they are seen to laugh through folly, and to-
morrow, to weep through despair; Today they are humhle and meek, tomorrow, proud and
furious. In a word, sinners change with prosperity and adversity; but the just are like the sun,
always the same, always serene in whatever happens to them. In the inferior part of the soul
they cannot but feel some pain at the misfortunes which befall them; but, as long as the will
remains united to the will of God, nothing can deprive them of that spiritual joy which is not
subject to the vicissitudes of this life. **_“Your joy no man shall take from you." (_** John xvi. 22.)


11. He that reposes in the divine will, is like a man placed above the clouds: he sees the
lightning, and hears the claps of thunder, and the raging of the tempest below, but he is not
injured or disturbed by them. And how can he be ever disturbed, when whatever he desires
always happens? He that desires only what pleases God, always obtains whatsoever he
wishes, because all that happens to him, happens through the will of God. Salvian says, that
**_Christians who are resigned, if they be in a low condition of life, wish to be in that state; if
they be poor, they desire poverty; because they wish whatever God wills, and therefore they
are always content. ”Humiles sunt, hoc volunt, pauperes sunt, paupertate delectantur: itaque
beati dicendisunt."_** If cold, or heat, or rain, or wind come on, he that is united to the will of
God says: I wish for this cold, this heat, this rain, and this wind, because God wills them. If
loss of property, persecution, sickness, or even death come upon him, he says: I wish for this
loss, this persecution, this sickness; I even wish for death, when it comes, because God wills
it. And how can a person who seeks to please God, enjoy greater happiness than that which



arises from cheerfully embracing the cross which God sends him, and from the conviction
that, in embracing it, he pleases God in the highest degree? So great was the joy which St.
Mary Magdalene de Pazzi used to feel at the bare mention of the will of God, that she would
fall into an ecstacy.



12. But, how great is the folly of those who resist the divine will, and, instead of receiving
tribulations with patience, get into a rage, and accuse God of treating them with injustice and
cruelty! Perhaps they expect that, in consequence of their opposition, what God wills shall
not happen? **_“Who resisteth his will ?"_** (Rom. ix. 19.) Miserable men! instead of lightening
the cross which God sends them, they make it more heavy and painful. **_“Who hath resisted
him, and hath peace ?"_** (Job ix. 4.) Let us be resigned to the divine will, and we shall thus
render our crosses light, and shall gain great treasures of merits for eternal life. In sending us
tribulations, God intends to make us saints. **_"This is the will of God, your sanctification."_** (1
Thess. iv. 3.) He sends us crosses, not because he wishes evil to us, but because he desires our
welfare, and because he knows that they are conducive to our salvation. **_"All things work
together unto good."_** (Rom. viii. 28.) Even the chastisements which come from the Lord are
not for our destruction, but for our good and for the correction of our faults. ” **_Let us believe
that these scourges of the Lord....have happened for our amendment, and not for our
destruction."_** (Jud. viii. 27.) God loves us so tenderly, that he not only desires, but is solicitous
about our welfare. ” **_The Lord,"_** says David **_, ”is careful for me." (Ps. xxxix. 18.)_**


13. Let us, then, always throw ourselves into the hands of God, who so ardently desires and
so anxiously watches over our eternal salvation. ” **_Casting all your care upon him; for he hath
care of you."_** (1 Peter v. 7.) He who, during life, casts himself into the hands of God, shall lead
a happy life and shall die a holy death. He who dies resigned to the divine will, dies a saint;
but they who shall not have been united to the divine will during life, shall not conform to it
at death, and shall not be saved. The accomplishment of the divine will should be the sole
object of all our thoughts during the remainder of our days. To this end we should direct all
our devotions, our meditations, communions, visits to the blessed sacrament, and all our
prayers. We should constantly beg of God to teach and help us to do his will. **_"Teach me to
do thy will."_** (Ps. cxlii. 10.) Let us, at the same time, offer ourselves to accept without reserve
whatever he ordains, saying, with the Apostle: ” **_Lord, what wilt thou have me to do ?"_** (Acts
ix. 6.) Lord, tell me what thou dost wish me to do I desire to do thy will. And in all things,
whether they be pleasing or painful, let us always have in our mouths that petition of the
**_PATER NOSTER-”Thy will be done”_** Let us frequently repeat it in the day, with all the
affection of our hearts. Happy we, if we live and die saying: ” **_Thy will be done” “Thy will be
done!"_**


**SERMON XXIX. TRINITY SUNDAY. - ON THE LOVE OF THE THREE DIVINE
PERSONS FOR MAN.**
**_Going, therefore teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost." (MATT. xxviii. 19)_**


ST. LEO has said, that the nature of God **_is by its essence, goodness itself. ”Deus cujus natura
bonitas”Now, goodness naturally diffuses itself. ”Bonum est sui diffusivum."_** And by
experience we know that men of a good heart are full of love for all, and desire to share with
all the goods which they enjoy God being infinite goodness, is all love towards us his



creatures. Hence St. John calls him pure love pure charity. "God is charity." (1 John iv. 8.)
And therefore he ardently desires to make us partakers of his own happiness. Faith teaches
us how much the Three Divine Persons have done through love to man, and to enrich him
with heavenly gifts. In saying to his apostles” **_Teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the
name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost_** , ” Jesus Christ wished that they
should not only instruct the Gentiles in the mystery of the Most Holy Trinity but that they
should also teach them the love which the adorable Trinity bears to man. I intend to propose
this day for your consideration the love shown to us by the Father in our creation; secondly,
the love of the Son in our redemption; and thirdly, the love of the Holy Ghost, in our
sanctification.


**_First Point The love shown to us by the Father in our creation._**


1. ” **_I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore have I drawn thee, taking pity on
thee."_** (Jer. xxxi. 3.) My son, says the Lord, I have loved you for eternity, and, through love for
you, I have shown mercy to you by drawing you out of nothing. Hence, beloved Christians,
of all those who love you, God has been your first lover. Your parents have been the first to
love you on this earth; but they have loved you only after they had known you. But, before
you had a being, God loved you. Before your father or mother was born, God loved you; yes,
even before the creation of the world, he loved you. And how long before creation has God
loved you? Perhaps for a thousand years, or for a thousand ages. It is needless to count years
or ages; God loved you from eternity. **_"I have loved thee with an everlasting love."_** As long
as he has been God, he has luved you: as long as he has loved himself, he has loved you. The
thought of this love made St. Agnes the Virgin exclaim: **_“I am prevented by another lover."_**
When creatures asked her heart, she answered: **_“No: I cannot prefer you to my God. He has
been the first to love me; it is then but just that he should hold the first place in my
affections. ”_**



2. Thus, brethren, God has loved you from eternity, and through pure love, he has selected
you from among so many men whom he could have created in place of you; but he has left
them in their nothingness, and has brought you into existence, and placed you in the world.
For the love of you he has made so many other beautiful creatures, that they might serve you,
and that they might remind you of the love which he has borne to you, and of the gratitude
which you owe to him. **_"Heaven and Earth,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_and all things tell me to
love thee. ”_** When the saint beheld the sun, the stars, the mountains, the sea, the rains, they all
appeared to him to speak, and to say: Augustine, love God; for he has created us that you
might love him. When the Abbe de Ranee, the founder of La Trappe, looked at the hills, the
fountains, or flowers, he said that all these creatures reminded him of the love which God
had borne him. St. Teresa used to say, that these creatures reproached her with her
ingratitude to God.


Whilst she held a flower or fruit in her hand, St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi used to feel her
heart wounded with divine love, and would say within herself: Then, my God has thought
from eternity of creating this flower and this fruit that I might love him.


3. Moreover, seeing us condemned to hell, in punishment of our sins, the Eternal Father,
through love for us, has sent his Son on the earth to die on the cross, in order to redeem us



from hell, and to bring us with himself into Paradise. **_“God so loved the world, as to give his
only begotten Son”_** (John iii. 16), love, which the apostle calls an excess of love. **_"For his
exceeding charity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sin, has quickened us
together in Christ."_** (Eph. ii. 4, 5.)



4. See also the special love which God has shown you in bringing you into life in a Christian
country, and in the bosom of the Catholic or true Church. How many are born among the
pagans, among the Jews, among the Mahometans and heretics, and all are lost. Consider that,
compared with these, only a few not even the tenth part of the human race have the
happiness of being born in a country where the true faith reigns; and, among that small
number, he has chosen you. Oh! what an invaluable benefit is the gift of faith! How many
millions of souls, among infidels and heretics, are deprived of the sacraments, of sermons, of
good example, and of the other helps to salvation which we possess in the true Church. And
the Lord resolved to bestow on us all these great graces, without any merit on our part, and
even with the foreknowledge of our demerits. For when he thought of creating us and of
conferring these favours upon us, he foresaw our sins, and the injuries we would commit
against him.


**_Second Point. The love which the Son of God has shown to us in our redemption._**


5. Adam, our first father, sins by eating the forbidden apple, and is condemned to eternal
death, along with all his posterity. Seeing the whole human race doomed to perdition, God
resolved to send a redeemer to save mankind. Who shall come to accomplish their
redemption? Perhaps an angel or a seraph. No; the Son of God, the supreme and true God,
equal to the Father, offers himself to come on earth, and there to take human flesh, and to die
for the salvation of men. O prodigy of Divine love! Man, says St. Fulgentius, despises God,
and separates himself from God, and through love for him, God comes on earth to seek after
rebellious man. **_"Homo Deum contemnens, a Deo discessit: Deus hominem diligens, ad
homines venit."_** (Serm. in Nativ. Christ.) Since, says St. Augustine, we could not go to the
Redeemer, he has deigned to come to us. **_"Quia ad mediatorem venire non poteramus, ipse
ad nos venire dignatus est."_** And why has Jesus Christ resolved to come to us? According to
the same holy doctor, it is to convince us of his great love for us. ”Christ came, that man
might know how much God loves him."


6. Hence the Apostle writes: **_"The goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared."_** (Tit.
iii. 5.) In the Greek text, the words are **_: ”Singularis Dei erga homines apparuit amor :"“The
singular love of God towards men appeared."_** In explaining this passage, St. Bernard says,
that before God appeared on earth in human flesh, men could not arrive at a knowledge of
the divine goodness; therefore the Eternal Word took human nature, that, appearing in the
form of man, men might know the goodness of God. ” **_Priusquam apparet humanitas, latebat
beniguitas, sed undo tanta agnosci poterat? Venit in came ut, apparante humanitate,
cognosceretur benignitas."_** (Serm. i., in Eph.) And what greater love and goodness could the
Son of God show to us, than to become man and to become a worm like us, in order to save
us from, perdition? What astonishment would we not feel, if we saw a prince become a worm
to save the worms of his kingdom! And what shall we say at the sight of a God made man
like us, to deliver us from eternal death? **_"The word was made flesh."_** (John i. 14.) A God
made flesh! if faith did not assure us of it, who could ever believe it? Behold then, as St. Paul



says, a God as it were annihilated. ” **_He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant and in
habit found as a man. ”_** (Phil. ii. 7.) By these words the Apostle gives us to understand, that
the Son of God, who was filled with the divine majesty and power, humbled himself so as to
assume the lowly and impotent condition of human nature, taking the form or nature of a
servant, and becoming like men in his external appearance, although, as St. Chrysostom
observes, he was not a mere man, but man and God. Hearing a deacon singing the words of
St. John, **_"and the Word was made flesh,"_** St. Peter of Alcantara fell into ecstasy, and flew
through the air to the altar of the most holy sacrament.



7. But this God of love, the Incarnate Word, was not content with becoming flesh for the love
of man; but, according to Isaias, he wished to live among us, as the last and lowest, and most
afflicted of men. ” **_There is no beauty in him, nor comeliness: and we have seen him despised,
and the most abject of men, a man of sorrows."_** (Isa. iii. 2, 3.) He was a man of sorrows. Yes;
for the life of Jesus Christ was full of sorrows. **_Virum dolorum._** He was a man made on
purpose to be tormented with sorrows. From his birth till his death, the life of our Redeemer
was all full of sorrows.


8. And because he came on earth to gain our love, as he declared when he said **_“I am come to
cast fire on the earth; and what will I but that it be kindled ?"_** (Luke xii. 49), he wished at the
close of his life to give us the strongest marks and proofs of the love which he bears to us**_.
"Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end."_** (John xiii. 1.)
Hence he not only humbled himself to death for us, but he also chose to die the most painful
and opprobrious of all deaths. **_"He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even
unto the death of the cross."_** (Phil. ii. 8.) They who were crucified among the Jews, were
objects of malediction and reproach to all. **_“He is accursed of God that hangeth on a tree."_**
(Deut. xxi. 23.) Our Redeemer wished to die the shameful death of the cross, in the midst of a
tempest of ignominies and sorrows. **_“I am come into the depths of the sea, and a tempest
hath overwhelmed me."_** (Ps. lxviii. 3.)


9. ” **_In this”_** says St. John, **_"we have known the charity of God, because he hath laid down his
life for us."_** (1 John iii. 16.) And how could God give us a greater proof of his love than hy
laying down his life for us? Or, how is it possible for us to behold a God dead on the cross for
our sake, and not love him? **_"For the charity of Christ presseth us."_** (2 Cor. v. 14.) By these
words St. Paul tells us, that it is not so much what Jesus Christ has done and suffered for our
salvation, as the love which he has shown in suffering and dying for us, that obliges and
compels us to love him. He has, as the same Apostle adds, died for all, that each of us may
live no longer for himself, but only for that God who has given his life for the love of us.
**_“Christ died for all, that they also who live, may not live to themselves, but unto him who
died for them, and rose again."_** (2 Cor. v. 15.) And, to captivate our love, he has, after having
given his life for us, left himself for the food of our souls. **_“Take ye and eat: this is my body."_**
(Matt. xxvi. 26.) Had not faith taught that he left himself for our food, who could ever believe
it? But of the prodigy of divine love manifested in the holy sacrament, I shall speak on the
second Sunday after Pentecost Let us pass to a brief consideration of the third point.


**_Third Point. On the love shown to us by the Holy Ghost in our sanctification._**





10. The Eternal Father was not content with giving us his Son Jesus Christ, that he might save
us by his death; he has also given us the Holy Ghost, that he may dwell in our souls, and that
he may keep them always inflamed with holy love. In spite of all the injuries which he
received on earth from men, Jesus Christ, forgetful of their ingratitude, after having ascended
into heaven, sent us the Holy Ghost, that, by his holy flames, this divine spirit might kindle in
our hearts the fire of divine charity, and sanctify our souls. Hence, when he descended on the
apostles, he appeared in the form of tongues of fire. **_"And there appeared to them parted
tongues, as it were of fire."_** (Acts ii. 3.) Hence the Church prescribes the following prayer:
” **_We beseech thee, O Lord, that the Spirit may inflame us with that fire which the Lord Jesus
Christ sent on the earth, and vehemently wished to be enkindled."_** This is the holy fire which
inflamed the saints with the desire of doing great things for God, which enabled them to love
their most cruel enemies, to seek after contempt, to renounce all the riches and honours of the
world, and even to embrace with joy torments and death.


11. The Holy Ghost is that divine bond which unites the Father with the Son; it is he that
unites our souls, through love, with God. For, as St. Augustine says, an union with God is the
effect of love. **_"Charity is a virtue which unites us with God."_** The chains of the world are
chains of death, but the bonds of the Holy Ghost are bonds of eternal life, because they bind
us to God, who is our true and only life.


12. Let us also remember that all the lights, inspirations, divine calls, all the good acts which
we have performed during our life, all our acts of contrition, of confidence in the divine
mercy, of love, of resignation, have been the gifts of the Holy Ghost. ” **_Likewise the Spirit also
helpeth our infirmity; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit
himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings."_** (Rom. viii. 26.) Thus, it is the Holy Ghost
that prays for us; for we know not what we ought to ask, but the Holy Spirit teaches us what
we should pray for.


13. In a word, the Three Persons of the Most Holy Trinity have endeavoured to show the love
which God has borne us, that we may love him through gratitude. **_“When,"_** says St. Bernard,
” **_God loves, he wishes only to be loved. ”_** It is, then, but just that we love that God who has
been the first to love us, and to put us under so many obligations by so many proofs of
tender love. **_“Let us, therefore, love God, because God first hath loved us."_** (1 John iv. 19.) Oh!
what a treasure is charity! it is an infinite treasure, because it makes us partakers of the
friendship of God. ” **_She is an infinite treasure to men, which they that use become the friends
of God."_** (Wis. vii. 14.) But, to acquire this treasure, it is necessary to detach the heart from
earthly things. **_“Detach the heart from creatures,"_** says St. Teresa, "and you shall find God."
In a heart filled with earthly affections, there is no room for divine love. Let us therefore
continually implore the Lord in our prayers, communions, and visits to the blessed
sacrament, to give us his holy love; for this love will expel from our souls all affections for the
things of this earth. ” **_When,"_** says St. Francis de Sales, ” **_a house is on fire, all that is within is
thrown out through the windows_** ." By these words the saint meant, that when a soul is
inflamed with divine love, she easily detaches herself from creatures: and Father Paul
Segneri, the younger, used to say, **_that divine love is a thief that robs us of all earthly
affections, and makes us exclaim: ”What, O my Lord, but thee alone, do I desire ?"_**





14. ” **_Love is strong as death." (_** Cant. viii. 6.) As no creature can resist death when the hour of
dissolution arrives, so there is no difficulty which love, in a soul that loves God, does not
overcome. When there is question of pleasing her beloved, love conquers all things: it
conquers pains, losses, ignominies. ” **_Nihil tam durum quod non amoris igne vincatur."_** This
love made the martyrs, in the midst of torments, racks, and burning gridirons, rejoice, and
thank God for enabling them to suffer for him: it made the other saints, when there was no
tyrant to torment them, become, as it were, their own executioners, by fasts, disciplines, and
penitential austerities. St. Augustine says, that in doing what one loves there is no labour,
and if there be, the labour itself is loved. ” **_In eo quod amatur aut non laboratur, aut ipse
labor amatur."_**


**SERMON XXX. FIRST SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON CHARITY TO OUR
NEIGHBOUR.**
**_"For with the same measure that you shall mete withal, it shall be measured to you again."
LUKE vi. 38._**


IN this day’s gospel we find that Jesus Christ once said to his disciples: **_"Be ye merciful, as
your Father also is merciful."_** (Luke vi. 36.) As your heavenly Father is merciful towards you,
so must you be merciful to others. He then proceeds to explain how, and in what, we should
practise holy charity to our neighbour. **_"Judge not,"_** he adds, **_“and you shall not be judged"_**
(v. 37). Here he speaks against those who do not abstain from judging rashly of their
neighbours. ” **_For give, and you shall be forgiven"_** (ibid). He tells us that we cannot obtain
pardon of the offences we have offered to God, unless we pardon those who have offended
us. ” **_Give, and it shall be given to you"_** (v. 38). By these words he condemns those who wish
that God should grant whatsoever they desire, and are at the same time niggardly and
avaricious towards the poor. In conclusion he declares, that the measure of charity which we
use to our neighbour shall be the same that God will use towards us. Let us, then, see how
we should practise charity to our neighbour: we ought to practise it, first, in our thoughts;
secondly, in words; thirdly, by works.


**_First Point. How we should practise charity to our neighbour in our thoughts._**



1. "And this commandment we have from God, that he who loveth God, love also his
brother." (1 John iv. 21.) The same precept, then, which obliges us to love God, commands us
to love our neighbour. St. Catherine of Genoa said one day to the Lord: **_"My God, thou dost
wish me to love my neighbour; but I can love no one but thee."_** The Lord said to her in
answer **_: "My child, he that loves me loves whatsoever I love."_** Hence St. John says: ” **_If any
man say: I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar."_** (1 John iv. 20.) And Jesus Christ has
declared that he will receive, as done to himself, the charity which we practise towards the
least of his brethren.


2. Hence we must, in the first place, practise fraternal charity in our thoughts, by never
judging evil of any one without certain foundation. ” **_Judge not, and you shall not be judged."_**
He who judges without certain grounds that another has committed a mortal sin, is guilty of
a grievous fault; if he only rashly suspects another of a mortal sin, he commits at least a
venial offence. But, to judge or suspect evil of another is not sinful when we have certain
grounds for the judgment or suspicion. However, he that has true charity thinks well of all,



and banishes from his mind both judgments and suspicions. **_"Charity thinketh no evil."_** (1
Cor. xiii. 5.) The heads of families are obliged to suspect the evil which may be done by those
who are under their care. Certain fathers and foolish mothers knowingly allow their sons to
frequent bad company and houses in which there are young females, and permit their
daughters to be alone with men. They endeavour to justify the neglect of their children by
saying: ” **_I do not wish to entertain bad thoughts of others."_** O folly of parents! They are in
such cases bound to suspect the evil which may happen; and, in order to prevent it, they
should correct their children. But they that are not entrusted with the care of others, ought to
abstain carefully from inquiring after the defects and conduct of others.



3. When sickness, loss of property, or any misfortune happens to a neighbour, charity
requires that we regret, at least with the superior part of the soul, the evil that has befallen
him. I say, ” **_with the superior part of the soul ;"_** for, when we hear of the misfortunes of an
enemy, our inferior appetite appears to feel delight; but, as long as we do not consent to that
delight, we are not guilty of sin. However, it is sometimes lawful to desire, or to be pleased
at, the temporal evil of another, when we expect that it will be productive of spiritual good to
himself or to others. For example: it is lawful, according to St. Gregory, to rejoice at the
sickness or misfortune of an obstinate and scandalous sinner, and even to desire that he may
fall into sickness or poverty, in order that he may cease to lead a wicked life, or at least to
scandalize others. Behold the words of St. Gregory: **_"Evenire plerumque potest, ut non amissa
charitate, et inimici nostri ruina lætificet, et ejus gloria sine invidiæ culpa contristet; cum et,
ruente eo, quosdam bene erigi credimus, et proficiente illo plerosque injuste opprimi
formidamus."_** (Lib. xxii., Moral., cap. ii.) But, except in such cases, it is unlawful to rejoice at
the loss of a neighbour. It is also contrary to charity to feel regret at a neighbour’s prosperity
merely because it is useful to him. This is precisely the sin of envy. The envious are,
according to the Wise Man, on the side of the devil, who, because he could not bear to see
men in heaven, from which he had been banished, tempted Adam to rebel against God. **_"But
by the envy of the devil death came into the world; and they follow him that are of his side."_**
(Wis. ii. 25.) Let us pass to the next point.


**_Second Point. On the charity which we ought to practise towards our neighbour in words._**


4. With regard to the practice of fraternal charity in words, we ought, in the first place, and
above all, to abstain from all detraction**_. ”The tale-bearer shall defile his own soul, and shall
be hated by all."_** (Eccl. xxi. 31.) As they who always speak well of others are loved by all, so
he who detracts his neighbour is hateful to all to God and to men, who, although they take
delight in listening to detraction, hate the detractor, and are on their guard against him. St.
Bernard says that the tongue of a detractor is a three-edged sword. ” **_Gladius equidem anceps,
immo triplex est lingua detractoris"_** (in Ps. Ivi). With one of these edges it destroys the
reputation of a neighbour; with the second it wounds the souls of those who listen to the
detraction; and with the third it kills the soul of the detractor by depriving him of the divine
grace. You will say: ”I have spoken of my neighbour only in secret to my friends, and have
made them promise not to mention to others what I told them." This excuse will not stand:
no; you are, as the Lord says, the serpent that bites in silence. ” **_If a serpent bite in silence, he
is nothing better that backbiteth secretly."_** (Eccl. x. 11.) Your secret defamation bites and
destroys the character of a neighbour. They who indulge in the vice of detraction are
chastised not only in the next, but also in. this life, because their uncharitable tongues are the



cause of a thousand sins, by creating discord in whole families and entire villages. Thomas
Cantaprensis (Apum, etc., cap. xxxvii.) **_relates, that he knew a certain detractor, who at the
end of life became raging mad, and died lacerating his tongue with his teeth. The tongue of
another detractor, who was going to speak ill of St. Malachy, instantly swelled and was
filled with worms. And, after seven days, the unhappy man died miserably._**



5. Detraction is committed not only when we take away a neighbours character, by imputing
to him a sin which he has not committed, or exaggerating his guilt, but also when we make
known to others any of his secret sins. Some persons, when they know anything injurious to
a neighbour, appear to suffer, as it were, the pains of childbirth, until they tell it toothers.
When the sin of a neighbour is secret and grievous, it is a mortal sin to mention it to others
without a just cause. I say, **_"without a just cause ;"_** for, to make known to a parent the fault
of a child, that he may correct him and prevent a repetition of the fault, is not sinful, but is an
act of virtue; for according to St. Thomas (2, 2, qu. 2, art. 73), to let others know the sins of a
neighbour is unlawful, when it is done to destroy his reputation, but not when it is done for
his good, or for the good of others.


6. They who listen to detraction, and afterwards go and tell what was said to the person
whose character had been injured, have to render a great account to. These are called
talebearers. Oh! how great is the evil produced by these talebearing tongues that are thus
employed in sowing discord. They are objects of God’s hatred. **_"The Lord hateth him that
soweth discord among brethren."_** (Prov. vi. 16, 19.) Should the person who has been defamed
speak of his defamer, the injury which he has received may, perhaps, give him some claim to
compassion. But why should you relate what you have heard? Is it to create ill-will and
hatred that shall be the cause of a thousand sins? If, from this day forward, you ever hear
anything injurious to a neighbour, follow the advice of the Holy Ghost. ” **_Hast thou heard a
word against thy neighbour? let it die with thee."_** (Eccl. xix. 10.) You should not only keep it
shut up in your heart, but you must let it die within you. He that is only shut up may escape
and be seen; but he that is dead cannot leave the grave. When, then, you know anything
injurious to your neighbour, you ought to be careful not to give any intimation of it to others
by words, by motions of the head, or by any other sign. Sometimes greater injury is done to
others by certain singular signs and broken words than by a full statement of their guilt;
because these hints make persons suspect that the evil is greater than it really is.


7. In your conversations be careful not to give pain to any companion, either present or
absent, by turning him into ridicule. You may say: **_"I do it through jest;"_** but such jests are
contrary to charity. **_"All things, therefore,"_** says Jesus Christ, ” **_that you will that men should
do to you, do you also unto them."_** (Matt. vii. 12.) Would you like to be treated with derision
before others? Give up, then, the practice of ridiculing your neighbours. Abstain also from
contending about useless trifles. Some times, certain contests about mere trifles grow so
warm that they end in quarrels and injurious words. Some persons are so full of the spirit of
contradiction, that they controvert what others say, without any necessity, and solely for the
sake of contention, and thus violate charity. ” **_Strive not,"_** says the Holy Ghost, ” **_in matters
which do not concern thee."_** (Eccl. xi. 9.) But they will say: **_“I only defend reason; I cannot
bear these assertions which are contrary to reason."_** In answer to these defenders of reason,
Cardinal Bellarmine says, that an ounce of charity is better than a hundred loads of reason. In
conversation, particularly when the subject of it is unimportant, state your opinion, if you



wish to take part in the discourse, and then keep yourself in peace, and be on your guard
against obstinacy in defending your own opinion. In such contests it is always better to yield.
B. Egidius used to say, that he who gives up conquers; because he is superior in virtue, and
preserves peace, which is far more valuable than a victory in such contests. St. Joseph
Calasanctius was accustomed to say, that **_"he who loves peace never contradicts any one."_**



8. Thus, dearly beloved brethren, if you wish to be loved by God and by men, endeavour
always to speak well of all. And, should you happen to hear a person speak ill of a
neighbour, be careful not to encourage his uncharitableness, nor to show any curiosity to
hear the faults of others. If you do, you will be guilty of the same sin which the detractor
commits. ” **_Hedge in thy ears with thorns,"_** says Ecclesiasticus, ” **_and hear not a wicked
tongue."_** (Eccl. xxviii. 28.) When you hear any one taking away the character of another, place
around your ears a hedge of thorns, that detraction may not enter. For this purpose it is
necessary, at least, to show that the discourse is not pleasing to you. This may be done by
remaining silent, by putting on a sorrowful countenance, by casting down the eyes, or
turning your face in another direction. In a word, act, says St. Jerome, in such a way that the
detractor, seeing your unwillingness to listen to him, may learn to be more guarded for the
future against the sin of detraction. ” **_Discat detractor, dum te videt non libenter audire, non
facile detrahere."_** (S. Hier. ep. ad Nepot.) And when it is in your power to do it, it will be a
great act of charity to defend the character of the persons who have been defamed. The
Divine Spouse wishes that the words of his beloved be a veil of scarlet. ” **_Thy lips are as a
scarlet lace."_** (Cant. iv. 3.) That is, as Theodoret explains this passage, her words should be
dictated by charity (a scarlet lace), that they may cover, as much as possible, the defects of
others, at least by excusing their intentions, when their acts cannot be excused. ” **_If,"_** says St.
Bernard, ” **_you cannot excuse the act, excuse the intention. ”_** (Serm. xl. in Cant.) It was a
proverb among the nuns of the convent of St. Teresa, that, in the presence of their holy
mother, their reputation was secure, because they knew she would take the part of those of
whom any fault might be mentioned.


9. Charity also requires that we be meek to all, and particularly to those who are opposed to
us. When a person is angry with you, and uses injurious language, remember that a **_"mild
answer breaketh wrath."_** (Prov. xv. 1.) Reply to him with meekness, and you shall find that
his anger will be instantly appeased. But, if you resent the injury, and use harsh language,
you will increase the same; the feeling of revenge will grow more violent, and you will
expose yourself to the danger of losing your soul by yielding to an act of hatred, or by
breaking out into expressions grievously injurious to your neighbour. Whenever you feel the
soul agitated by passion, it is better to force yourself to remain silent, and to make no reply;
for, as St. Bernard says, an eye clouded with anger cannot distinguish between right and
wrong. ” **_Turbatus præ ira oculus rectum non videt."_** (Lib. 2 de Consid., cap. xi.) Should it
happen that in a fit of passion you have insulted a neighbour, charity requires that you use
every means to allay his wounded feelings, and to remove from his heart all sentiments of
rancour towards you. The best means of making reparation for the violation of charity is to
humble yourself to the person whom you have offended. With regard to the meekness which
we should practise towards others, I shall speak on that subject in the thirty-fourth Sermon,
or the Sermon for the fifth Sunday after Pentecost.





10. It is also an act of charity to correct sinners. Do not say that you are not a superior. Were
you a superior, you should be obliged by your office to correct all those who might be under
your care; but, although you are not placed over others, you are, as a Christian, obliged to
fulfil the duty of fraternal correction. ” **_He gave to every one of them commandment
concerning his neighbour."_** (Eccl. xvii. 12.) Would it not be great cruelty to see a blind man
walking on the brink of a precipice, and not admonish him of his danger, in order to preserve
him from temporal death? It would be far greater cruelty to neglect, for the sake of avoiding a
little trouble, to deliver a brother from eternal death.


**_Third Point. On the charity we ought to practise towards our neighbour by works._**


11. Some say that they love all, but will not put themselves to any inconvenience in order to
relieve the wants of a neighbour. **_"My little children,"_** says St. John, **_"let us not love in word,
nor in tongue, but in deed and truth."_** (1 John iii. 18 ) The Scripture tells us that alms deliver
men from death, cleanse them from sin, and obtain for them the divine mercy and eternal
life. **_"Alms delivereth from death, and the same is that which purgeth away sins, and maketh
to find mercy and life everlasting."_** (Job xii. 9.) God will relieve you in the same manner in
which, you give relief to your neighbour. **_"With what measure you shall mete, it shall be
measured to you again. ”_** (Matt. vii. 2.) Hence St. Chrysostom says, that the exercise of charity
to others is the means of acquiring great gain with God. **_"Alms is, of all acts, the most
lucrative."_** And St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi used to say, that she felt more happy in reliev
ing her neighbour than when she was wrapt up in
contemplation**_. "Because, she would add when I am in contemplation God assists me; but in
giving relief to a neighbour I assist God ;"_** for, every act of charity which we exercise towards
our neighbour, God accepts as if it were done to himself. But, on the other hand, how, as St.
John says, can he who does not assist a brother in want, be said to love God?” **_He that hath
the substance of this world, and shall see his brother in need, and shall shut up his bowels
from him, how doth the charity of God abide in him ?"_** (1 John iii. 17.) By alms is understood,
not only the distribution of money or other goods, but every succour that is given to a
neighbour in order to relieve his wants.


12. If charity obliges us to assist all, it commands us still more strictly to relieve those who are
in tbe greatest need; such as the souls in Purgatory. St. Thomas teaches, that charity extends
not only to the living, but also to the dead. Hence, as we ought to assist our neighbours who
are in this life, so we are bound to give relief to those holy prisoners who are so severely
tormented by fire, and who are incapable of relieving themselves. A deceased monk of the
Cistercian order appeared to the sacristan of his monastery, and said to him: **_"Brother, assist
me by your prayers; for I can do nothing for myself."_** (Cron. Cist.) Let us, then, assist, to the
utmost of our power, these beloved spouses of Jesus Christ, by recommending them every
day to God, and by sometimes getting Mass offered for their repose. There is nothing which
gives so much relief to those holy souls as the sacrifice of the altar. They certainly will not be
ungrateful; they will in return pray for you, and will obtain for you still greater graces, when
they shall have entered into the kingdom of God.


13. To exercise a special charity towards the sick, is also very pleasing to God. They are
afflicted by pains, by melancholy, by the fear of death, and are sometimes abandoned by
others. Be careful to relieve them by alms, or by little presents, and to serve them as well as



you can, at least by endeavouring to console them by your words, and by exhortations to
practise resignation to the will of God, and to offer to him all their sufferings.



14. Above all, be careful to practise charity to those who are opposed to you. Some say: I am
grateful to all who treat me with kindness; but I cannot exercise charity towards those who
persecute me. Jesus Christ says that even pagans know how to be grateful to those who do
them a service. **_"Do not also the heathens this ?"_** (Matt. v. 47.) Christian charity consists in
wish ing well, and in doing good to those who hate and injure us. **_"But I say to you: Love
your enemies; do good to them that hate you; and pray for them that persecute and
calumniate you."_** (Matt. v. 44.) Some seek to injure you, but you must love them. Some have
done -evil to you, but you must return good for evil. Such the vengeance of the saints. This is
the heavenly revenge which St. Paulinus exhorts us to inflict on our enemies. ” **_To repay good
for evil is heavenly revenge. ”_** (Epis. xvi.) St. Chrysostom teaches, that there is nothing which
assimilates us so much to God as the granting of pardon to enemies. **_"Nothing makes men so
like to God as to spare enemies."_** (Hom, xxvii. in Gen.) Such has been the practice of the
saints. St. Catherine of Genoa continued for a long time to relieve a woman who had
endeavoured to destroy the saints reputation. On an assassin, who had made an attempt on
his life, St. Ambrose settled a sum for his support. Venustanus, governor of Tuscany, ordered
the hands of St. Sabinus to be cut off, because the holy bishop confessed the true faith. The
tyrant, feeling a violent pain in his eyes, entreated the saint to assist him. The saint prayed for
him, and raised his arm, from which the blood still continued to flow, blessed him, and
obtained for him the cure of his eyes and of his soul; for the tyrant became a convert to the
faith. Father Segneri relates, that the son of a certain lady in Bologna was murdered by an
assassin, who by accident took refuge in her house. (Christ. Instr., part 1, disc. 20, n. 20.) What
did she do? She first concealed him from the ministers of justice, and afterwards said to him:
**_Since I have lost my son, you shall henceforth be my son and my heir. Take, for the present,
this sum of money, and provide for your safety elsewhere, for here you are not secure._** It is
thus the saints resent injuries. With what face, says St. Cyril of Jerusalem, can he that does not
pardon the affronts which he receives from his enemies, say to God: **_Lord, pardon me the
many insults which I have offered to thee?”Qua fronte dices Domino: remitte mihi multa
peccata mea, si tu pauca conserve tuo non remiseris?"_** (Catech. ii.) But he that forgives his
enemies is sure of the pardon of the Lord, who says: **_"Forgive, and you shall be forgiven."_**
(Luke vi. 37.) And when you cannot serve them in any other way, recommend to God those
who persecute and calumniate you. **_"Pray for them that persecute and calumniate you."_** This
is the admonition of Jesus Christ, who is able to reward those who treat their enemies in this
manner.


**SERMON XXXI. SECOND SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON HOLY COMMUNION.**
**_"A certain man made a great supper." LUKE xiv. 16._**


IN the gospel of this day we read that a rich man prepared a great supper. He then ordered
one of his servants to invite to it all those whom he should find in the highways, even though
they were poor, blind, and lame, and to compel those who should refuse, to come to the
supper. **_"Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house
may be filled"_** (v. 2 0 ). And he added, that of all those who had been invited and had not
come, not one should ever partake of his supper. **_"But I say unto you, that none of those men
that were invited shall taste of my supper"_** (v. 24). This supper is the holy communion; it is a



great supper, at which all the faithful are invited to eat the sacred flesh of Jesus Christ in the
most holy sacrament of the altar. **_"Take ye and eat: this is my body."_** (Matt. xxiv. 26.) Let us
then consider today, in the first point, the great love which Jesus Christ has shown us in
giving us himself in this sacrament; and, in the second point, how we ought to receive him in
order to draw great fruit from the holy communion.


**_First Point. On the great love which Jesus Christ has shown us in giving us himself in this
sacrament._**


1. ” **_Jesus, knowing that his hour was come that he should pass out of this world to the
Father, having loved his own that were in the world, he loved them unto the end. ”_** (John xiii.
1.) Knowing that the hour of his death had arrived, Jesus Christ wished, before his departure
from this world, to leave us the greatest proof which he could give of his love, by leaving us
himself in the holy eucharist. ”He loved them to the end." That is, according to St.
Chrysostom, ”with an extreme love." St. Bernardino of Sienna says that the tokens of love
which are given at death make a more lasting impression on the mind, and are more highly
esteemed. ” **_Quæ in fine in signum amicitiæ celebrantur, firmius memoriæ imprimuntur et
cariora tenentur."_** But, whilst others leave a ring, or a piece of money, as a mark of their
affection, Jesus has left us himself entirely in this sacrament of love.



2. And when did Jesus Christ institute this sacrament? He instituted it, as the Apostle has
remarked, on the night before his passion. **_"The Lord Jesus, the same night on which he was
betrayed, took bread, and giving thanks, broke and said: "Take ye and eat: this is my body."_**
(1 Cor. xi. 23, 24.) Thus, at the very time that men were preparing to put him to death, our
loving Redeemer resolved to bestow upon us this gift. Jesus Christ, then, was not content
with giving his life for us on a cross: he wished also, before his death, to pour out, as the
Council of Trent says, all the riches of his love, by leaving himself for our food in the holy
communion. **_"He, as it were, poured out the riches of his love towards man."_** (Sess. 13, cap.
ii.) If faith had not taught it, who could ever imagine that a God would become man, and
afterwards become the food of his own creatures? When Jesus Christ revealed to his
followers this sacrament which he intended to leave us, St. John says, that they could not
bring themselves to believe it, and departed from him saying: ” **_How can this man give us his
flesh to eat ?...This saying is hard, and who can hear it?”_** (St. John vi. 53, 61.) But what men
could not imagine, the reat love of Jesus Christ has invented and effected. ” **_Take ye and eat:
this is my body."_** These words he addressed to his apostles on the night before he suffered,
and he now, after his death, addresses them to us.


3. **_“How highly honoured, ”_** says St. Francis de Sales, **_“would that man fed to whom the king
sent from his table a portion of what he had on his own plate? But how should he feel if that
portion were a part of the king‟s arm?”_** In the holy communion Jesus gives us, not a part of
his arm, but his entire body in the sacrament of the altar. **_"He gave you all,"_** says St.
Chrysostom, reproving our ingratitude, ” **_he left nothing for Himself. ”_** And St. Thomas
teaches, that **_in the eucharist God has given us all that he is and all that he has. "Deus in
eucharistia totum quod est et habet, dedit nobis."_** (Opusc. 63, c. ii.) Justly then has the same
saint called the eucharist” **_a sacrament of love; a pledge of love. ”“Sacramentum charitatis
pignus charitatis."_** It is a sacrament of love, because it was pure love that induced Jesus
Christ to give us this gift and pledge of love: for he wished that, should a doubt of his having



loved us ever enter into our minds, we should have in this sacrament a pledge of his love. St.
Bernard calls this **_sacrament”love of loves."“Amor amorum."_** By his incarnation, the Lord
has given himself to all men in general; but, in this sacrament, he has given, himself to each
of us in particular, to make us understand the special love which he entertains for each of us.



4. Oh! how ardently does Jesus Christ desire to come to our souls in the holy communion!
This vehement desire he expressed at the time of the institution of this sacrament, when he
said to the apostles: ” **_With desire I have desired to eat this Pasch with you."_** (Luke xxii. 15.)
St. Laurence Justinian says that **_these words proceeded from the enamoured heart of Jesus
Christ, who, by such tender expressions, wished to show us the ardent love with which he
loved us. ”This is the voice
of the most burning charity. ”Flagrantissimæ charitatis est vox hæc."_** And, to induce us to
receive him frequently in the holy communion, he promises eternal life that is, the kingdom
of heaven to those who eat his flesh. ” **_He that eateth this bread shall live for ever_** ." (John vi.
59.) On the other hand, it threatens to deprive us of his grace and of Paradise, if we neglect
communion. ” **_Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you shall not
have life in you."_** (John vi. 54.) These promises and these threats all sprung from a burning
desire to come to us in this sacrament.


5. And why does Jesus Christ so vehemently desire that we receive him in the holy
communion? It is because he takes delight in being united with each of us. By the
communion, Jesus is really united to our soul and to our body, and we are united to Jesus.
**_"He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood, abideth in me and I in him_** ." (John vi. 57.)
Thus, after communion, we are, says St. Chrysostom, one body and one flesh with Jesus
Christ. ” **_Huic nos unimur, et facti summus unum corpus ut una caro."_** (Hom. lxviii. ad Pop.
Ant.) Hence St. Laurence Justinian exclaims: **_"Oh! how wonderful is thy love, O Lord Jesus,
who hast wished to incorporate us in such a manner with thy body, that we should have one
heart and one soul inseparably united with thee."_** Thus, to every soul that receives the
eucharist, the Lord says what he once said to his beloved servant Margaret of Ipres” **_Behold,
my daughter, the close union made between me and thee; love me, then, and let us remain for
ever united in love: let us never more be separated."_** This union between us and Jesus Christ
is, according to St. Chrysostom, the effect of the love which Jesus Christ bears us.
” **_Semetipsum nobis immiscuit, ut unum quid simus ardentur enim amantium hoc est. ”_** (Hom.
lxi.) But, Lord, such intimate union with man is not suited to thy divine majesty. But love
seeks not reason; it goes not where it ought to go, but where it is drawn. ”Amor ratione caret,
et vadit quo dicitur, non quo debeat." (Serm. cxliii.) St. Bernardino of Sienna says that, in
giving himself for our food, Jesus Christ loved us to the last degree; because he united
himself entirely to us, as food is united to those who eat it. **_"Ultimus gradus amoris est, cum
se dedit nobis in cibum quia dedit se nobis ad omnimodam unionem, sicut cibus et cibans,
invicem uniuntur."_** (Tom. 2, Serm. liv.) The same doctrine has been beautifully expressed by
St. Francis de Sales. ” **_No action of the Saviour can be more loving or more tender than the
institution of the holy eucharist, in which he, as it were, annihilates himself, and takes the
form of food, to unite himself to the souls and bodies of his faithful servants."_**


6. Hence, there is nothing from which we can draw so much fruit as from the holy
communion. St. Denis teaches, that **_the most holy sacrament has greater efficacy to sanctify
souls than all other spiritual means. ”Eucharistia maxim am vim habet perficiendæ_**



**_sanctitatis."_** St. Vincent Ferrer says, that **_a soul derives more profit from one communion
than from fasting a week on bread and water._** The eucharist is, according to the holy Council
of Trent **_, a medicine which delivers us from venial, and preserves us from mortal sins.
“Antidotum quo a culpis quotidianis liberemur, et a rnortalibus præservemur."_** Jesus himself
has said, that they who eat him, who is the fountain of life, shall receive permanently the life
of grace. **_"He that eateth me, the same shall also live by me."_** (John vi. 58.) Innocent the Third
teaches, that **_by the passion Jesus Christ delivers us from the sins we have committed, and by
the eucharist from the sins we may commit._** According to St. Chrysostom, **_the holy
communion inflames us with the fire of divine love, and makes us objects of terror to the
devil. ”The eucharist is a fire which inflames us, that, like lions breathing fire, we may retire
from the altar, being made terrible to the devil."_** (Hom. lxi. ad Pop. Ant.) In explaining the
words of the Spouse of the Canticles, **_"He brought me into the cellar of wine; lie set in order
charity in me"_** (ii. 4.) St. Gregory says, that **_the communion is this cellar of wine, in which the
soul is so inebriated with divine love, that she forgets and loses sight of all earthly things._**



7. Some will say: ” **_I do not communicate often; because I am cold in divine love."_** In answer
to them Gerson asks, Will you then, because you feel cold, remove from the fire? When you
are tepid you should more frequently approach this sacrament. St. Bonaventure says:
” **_Trusting in the mercy of God, though you feel tepid, approach: let him who thinks himself
unworthy reflect, that the more infirm he feels himself the more he requires a physician"_** (de
Prof. Rel., cap. lxxviii). And, in” **_The Devout Life," chapter xx., St. Francis de Sales writes:
”Two sorts of persons ought to communicate often: the perfect, to preserve perfection; and
the imperfect, to arrive at perfection."_** It cannot be doubted, that he who wishes to
communicate should prepare himself with great diligence, that he may communicate well.
Let us pass to the second point.


**_Second Point. On the preparation we ought to make in order to derive great fruit from the
holy communion._**


8. Two things are necessary in order to draw great fruit from communion preparation for,
and thanksgiving after communion. As to the preparation, it is certain that the saints derived
great profit from their communions, only because they were careful to prepare themselves
well for receiving the holy eucharist. It is easy then to understand why so many souls remain
subject to the same imperfections, after all their communions. Cardinal Bona says, that **_the
defect is not in the food, but in the want of preparation for it. ”Defectus non in bibo est, sed
in edentis dispositione."_** For frequent communion two principal dispositions are necessary.
The first is detachment from creatures, and disengagement of the heart from everything that
is not God. The more the heart is occupied with earthly concerns, the less room there is in it
for divine love. Hence, to give full possession of the whole heart to God, it is necessary to
purify it from worldly attachments. This is the preparation which Jesus himself recommends
to St. Gertrude. ” **_I ask nothing more of thee,"_** said he to her, ” **_than that thou come to receive
me with a heart divested of thyself."_** Let us, then, withdraw our affections from creatures,
and our hearts shall belong entirely to the Creator.


9. The second disposition necessary to draw great fruit from communion, is a desire of
receiving Jesus Christ in order to advance in his love. ” **_He,"_** says St. Francis de Sales, ” **_who
gives himself through pure love, ought to be received only through love."_** Thus, the principal



end of our communions must be to advance in the love of Jesus Christ. He once said to St.
Matilda: **_“When you communicate, desire all the love that any soul has ever had for me, and I
will accept your love in proportion to the fervour with which you wished for it."_**



10. Thanksgiving after communion is also necessary. The prayer we make after communion
is the most acceptable to God, and the most profitable to us. After communion the soul
should be employed in affections and petitions. The affections ought to consist not only in
acts of thanksgiving, but also in acts of humility, of love, and of oblation of ourselves to God.
Let us then humble ourselves as much as possible at the sight of a God made our food after
we had offended him. A learned author says that, for a soul after communion, the most
appropriate sentiment is one of astonishment at the thought of receiving a God. She should
exclaim: ” **_What! a God to me! a God to me!"_** Let us also make many acts of the love of Jesus
Christ. He has come into our souls in order to be loved. Hence, he is greatly pleased with
those who, after communion, say to him: **_"My Jesus, I love thee; I desire nothing but thee."_**
Let us also offer ourselves and all that we have to Jesus Christ, that he may dispose of all as
he pleases: and let us frequently say: ”My Jesus, thou art all mine; thou hast given thyself
entirely to me; I give myself entirely to thee.


11. After communion; we should not only make these affections, but we ought also to present
to God with great confidence many petitions for his graces. The time after communion is a
time in which we can gain treasures of divine graces. St. Teresa says, that at that time Jesus
Christ remains in the soul as on a throne, saying to her what he said to the blind man: ” **_What
wilt thou that I should do to thee ?"_** (Mark x. 51.) As if he said: ” **_But me you have not
always."_** (John xii. 8.) Now that you possess me within you, ask me for graces: I have come
down from heaven on purpose to dispense them to you; ask whatever you wish, and you
shall obtain it. Oh! what great graces are lost by those who spend but little time in prayer
after communion. Let us also turn to the Eternal Father, and, bearing in mind the promise of
Jesus Christ **_"Amen, amen, I say to you, if you ask the Father anything in my name, he will
give it you"_** (John xvi. 23) let us say to him: **_My God, for the love of this thy Son, whom I
have within my heart, give me thy love; make me all thine._** And if we offer this prayer with
confidence, the Lord will certainly hear us. He who acts thus may become a saint by a single
communion.


**SERMON XXXII. THIRD SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE MERCY OF GOD
TOWARDS SINNERS.**
**_" There shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than ninety -nine
just, who need not penance." LUKE xv. 7_**


In this day’s gospel it is related that the Pharisees murmured against Jesus Christ, because he
received sinners and eat with them. ” **_This man receiveth sinners and eateth with them"_** (v. 2).
In answer to their murmurings our Lord said: If any of you had a hundred sheep, and lost
one of them, would he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go in search of the lost
sheep? would he not continue his search until he found it? and having found it, would he not
carry it on his shoulders, and, rejoicing, say to his friends and neighbours: ” **_Rejoice with me,
because I have found my sheep that was lost ?"_** (v. 6.) In conclusion, the Son of God said: ” **_I
say to you, there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than, upon
ninety-nine just, that need not penance."_** There is more joy in heaven upon one sinner who



returns to God, than upon many just who preserve the grace of God. Let us, then, speak
Today on the mercy which God shows to sinners, first, in calling them to repentance;
secondly, in receiving them when they return.


**_First Point, Mercy of God in calling sinners to repentance._**



1. After having sinned hy eating the forbidden apple, Adam fled from the face of the Lord
through shame of the sin he had committed. What must have been the astonishment of the
angels when they saw God seeking after him, and calling him as it were with tears, saying:
” **_Adam, where art thou ?"_** (Gen. iii. 9.) My beloved Adam, where art thou? These words, says
Father Pereyra, in his commentary on this passage, ” **_are the words of a father in search of his
lost son."_** Towards you, brethren, the Lord acts in a similar manner. You fled from him and
he has so often invited you to repentance by means of confessors and preachers. Who was it
that spoke to you when they exhorted you to penance? It was the Lord. Preachers are, as St.
Paul says, his ambassadors. ” **_For Christ, therefore, we are ambassadors; God, as it were,
exhorting by us."_** (2 Cor. v. 20.) Hence he writes to the sinners of Corinth: ” **_For Christ, we
beseech you, be reconciled to God."_** (Ibid.) In explaining these words St. Chrysostom says **_:
”Ipse Chris tus vos obsecrat: quid autem obsecrat? Reconciliamini Deo." Then, says the holy
doctor, Jesus Christ himself entreats you, sinners: and what does he entreat you to do? To
make peace with God._** The saint adds: ” **_Non enim ipse inimicus gerit, sed vos." It is not God
that acts like an enemy, but you;_** that is, God does not refuse to make peace with sinners, but
they are unwilling to be reconciled with him."


2. But notwithstanding the refusal of sinners to return to God, he does not cease to continue
to call them by so many interior inspirations, remorses of conscience, and terrors of
chastisements. Thus, beloved Christians, God has spoken to you, and, seeing that you
disregarded his words, he has had recourse to scourges; he has called you to repentance by
such a persecution, by temporal losses, by the death of a relative, by sickness which has
brought you to the brink of the grave. He has, according to holy David, placed before your
eyes the bow of your damnation, not that you might be condemned to eternal misery, but
that you might be delivered from hell, which you deserved. **_"Thou hast given a warning to
them that fear thee, that they may flee from before the bow, that thy beloved may be
delivered."_** (Ps. lix. 6). You regarded certain afflictions as misfortunes; but they were mercies
from God; they were the voices of God calling on you to renounce sin, that you might escape
perdition. ” **_My jaws are become hoarse."_** (Ps. lxviii. 4.) My son, says the Lord, I have almost
lost my voice in calling you to repentance. ” **_I am weary of entreating thee."_** ( Jer. xv. (5.) I
have become weary in imploring you to offend me no more.


3. By your ingratitude you deserved that he should call you no more; but he has continued to
invite you to return to him. And who is it that has called you? It is a God of infinite majesty,
who is to be one day your judge, and on whom your eternal happiness or misery depends.
And what are you but miserable worms deserving hell? Why has he called you? To restore to
you the life of grace which you have lost. **_"Return ye and live."_** (Ezec. xviii. 32.) To acquire
the grace of God, it would be but little to spend a hundred years in a desert in fasting and
penitential austerities. But God offered it to you for a single act of sorrow; you refused that
act, and after your refusal he has not abandoned you, but has sought after you, saying: **_"And
why will you die, house of Israel?"_** (Ez. xviii. 31.) Like a father weeping and following his



son, who has voluntarily thrown himself into the sea, God has sought after you, saying,
through compassion to each of you: My son, why dost thou bring thyself to eternal
misery? **_”Why will you die, house of Israel ?"_**



4. As a pigeon that seeks to take shelter in a tower, seeing the entrance closed on every side,
continues to fly round till she finds an opening through which she enters, so, says St.
Augustine, **_did the divine mercy act towards me when I was in enmity with God. Circuibat
super me fidelis a longe misericordia tua."_** The Lord treated you, brethren, in a similar
manner. As often as you sinned you banished him from your souls. The wicked have said to
God: **_"Depart from us."_** (Job xxi. 14.) And, instead of abandoning you, what has the Lord
done? He has placed himself at the door of your ungrateful hearts, and, by his knocking, has
made you feel that he was outside, and seeking for admission. ” **_Behold I stand at the gate
and knock." (Apoc. iii. 20.) He, as it were, entreated you to have compassion on him, and to
allow him to enter. "Open to me, my sister."_** (Cant. v. 2.) Open to me; I will deliver you from
perdition; I will forget all the insults you have offered to me if you give up sin. Perhaps you
are unwilling to open to me through fear of becoming poor by restoring ill-gotten goods, or
by separating from a person who provided for you? Am not I, says the Lord, able to provide
for you? Perhaps you think that, if you renounce a certain friendship which separates you
from me, you shall lead a life of misery? Am I not able to content your soul and to make your
life happy? Ask those who love me with their whole hearts, and they will tell you that my
grace makes them content, and that they would not exchange their condition, though poor
and humble, for all the delights and riches of the monarchs of the earth.


**_Second Point. Mercy of God in waiting for sinners to return to him._**


5. We have considered the divine mercy in calling sinners to repentance: let us now consider
his patience in waiting for their return. That great servant of God, D. Sancia Carillo, a
penitent of Father John D’Avila, used to say, **_that the consideration of God‟s patience with
sinners made her desire to build a church, and entitle it”The Patience of God."_** Ah, sinners!
who could ever bear with what God has borne from you? If the offences which you have
committed against God had been offered to your best friends, or even to your parents, they
surely would have sought revenge. When you insulted the Lord he was able to chastise you;
you repeated the insult, and he did not punish your guilt, but preserved your life, and
provided you with sustenance. lie, as it were, pretended not to see the injuries you offered to
him, that you might enter into yourselves, and cease to offend him. **_"Thou overlookest the
sins of men for the sake of repentance_** ." (Wis. xi. 24.) But how, Lord, does it happen, that thou
canst not behold a single sin, and that thou dost bear in silence with so many? **_"Thy eyes are
too pure to behold evil, and thou canst not look on iniquity. Why lookest thou upon them
that do unjust things, and boldest thy peace ?"_** (Hab. i. 13.) Thou seest the vindictive prefer
their own before thy honour; thou beholdest the unjust, instead of restoring what they have
stolen, continuing to commit theft; the unchaste, instead of being ashamed of their impurities,
boasting of them before others; the scandalous, not content with the sins which they
themselves commit, but seeking to draw others into rebellion against thee; thou seest all this,
and holdest thy peace, and dost not inflict vengeance.
6. “ **_Omnis creatura,"_** says St. Thomas, **_"tibi factor! deserviens excandescit adversus injustos."_**
All creatures the earth, fire, air, water because they all obey God, would, by a natural instinct,



wish to punish the sinner, and to avenge the injuries which he does to the Creator; but God,
through his mercy, restrains them. But, Lord, thou waitest for the wicked that they may enter
into themselves; and dost thou not see that they abuse thy mercy to offer new insults to thy
majesty? **_"Thou hast been favourable to the nation, O Lord, thou hast been favourable to the
nation: art thou glorified ?"_** (Isa. xxvi. 15.) Thou hast waited so long for sinners; thou hast
abstained from inflicting punishment; but what glory have you reaped from thy forbearance?
They have become more wicked. Why so much patience with such ungrateful souls? Why
dost thou continue to wait for their repentance? Why dost thou not chastise their
wickedness? The same Prophet answers: **_"The Lord waiteth that he may have mercy on you."
(_** Isa. xxx. 18.) God waits for sinners that they may one day repent, and that after their
repentance, he may pardon and save them. **_"As I live, saith the Lord, I desire not the death of
the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live."_** (Ezech. xxxiii. 11.) St. Augustine
**_goes so far as to say that the Lord, if he were not God, should he unjust on account of his
excessive patience towards sinners. ”Deus, Deus incus, pace tua dicam, nisi quia Deus esses,
injustus esses."_** By waiting for those who abuse his patience to multiply their sins, God
appears to do an injustice to the divine honour. ” **_We,"_** continues the saint, **_"sin; we adhere to
sin (some of us become familiar and intimate with sin, and sleep for months and years in this
miserable state); we rejoice at sin (some of us go so far as to boast of our wickedness); and
thou art appeased! "We provoke thce to anger thou dost invite us to mercy."_** We and God
appear to be, as it were, engaged in a contest, in which we labour to provoke him to chastise
our guilt, and he invites us to pardon.



7. Lord, exclaimed holy Job, what is man, that thou dost entertain so great an esteem for him?
Why dost thou love him so tenderly?” **_What is man that thou shouldst magnify him? or why
dost thou set thy heart upon him ?"_** (Job. vii. ] 7.) St. Denis the Areopagite says, that God
seeks after sinners like a despised lover, entreating them not to destroy themselves. ” **_Deus
etiam a se aversos amatorie sequitur, et deprecatur ne pereant."_** Why, ungrateful souls, do
you fly from me? I love you and desire nothing but your welfare. Ah, sinners! says St. Teresa,
remember that he who now calls and seeks after you, is that God who shall one day be your
judge. If you are lost, the great mercies which he now shows you, shall be the greatest
torments which, you shall suffer in hell.


**_Third Point. Mercy of God in receiving penitent sinners._**


8. Should a subject who has rebelled against an earthly monarch go into the presence of his
sovereign to ask pardon, the prince instantly banishes the rebel from his sight, and does not
condescend even to look at him. But God does not treat us in this manner, when we go with
humility before him to implore mercy and forgiveness. **_"The Lord your God is merciful, and
will not turn away his face from you if you return to him."_** (2 Par. xxx. 9.) God cannot turn
away his face from those who cast themselves at his feet with an humble and contrite heart.
Jesus himself has protested that he will not reject any one who returns to him. **_"And him that
cometh to me, I will not cast out_** ." (John vi. 3 7.) But how can he reject those whom he himself
invites to return, and promises to embrace?” **_Return to me, saith the Lord, and I will receive
thee."_** (Jer. iii. 1.) In another place he says: Sinners, I ought to turn my back on you, because
you first turned your back on me; but be converted to me, and I will be converted to you.
**_"Turn to me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts."_** (Zach. i.
3.)



### 


9. Oh! with what tenderness does God embrace a sinner that returns to him! This tenderness
Jesus Christ wished to declare to us when he said that he is the good pastor, who, as soon as
he finds the lost sheep, embraces it and places it on his own shoulders. ” **_And when he hath
found it, doth he not lay it upon his shoulders rejoicing?"_** (Luke xv. 5.) This tenderness also
appears in the parable of the prodigal son, in which Jesus Christ tells us that he is the good
father, who, when his lost son returns, goes to meet him, embraces and kisses him, and, as it
were, swoons away through joy in receiving him. ” **_And running to him, he fell upon his neck
and kissed him."_** (Luke xv. 20.)


10. God protests that when sinners repent of their iniquities, he will forget all their sins, as if
they had never offended him. **_"But, if the wicked do penance for all the sins which he hath
committed. .. .living, he shall live, and shall not die. I will not remember all his iniquities
that he hath done."_** (Ezech. xviii. 21,22.) By the Prophet Isaias, the Lord goes so far as to say:
**_"Come and accuse me, saith the Lord. If your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made white as
snow."_** (Isa. i. 18.) Mark the words, **_Come and accuse me._** As if the Lord said: Sinners, come to
me, and if I do not pardon and embrace you, reprove me, upbraid me with violating my
promise. But no! God cannot despise an humble and contrite heart. **_"A contrite and humble
heart, O God, thou wilt not despise."_** (Ps. l. 19.)


11. To show mercy and grant pardon to sinners, God regards as redounding to his own glory.
**_"And therefore shall he be exalted sparing you."_** (Isa. xxx. 18.) The holy Church says, that
God displays his omnipotence in granting pardon and mercy to sinners. ” **_O God, who
manifested thy omnipotence in sparing and showing mercy."_** Do not imagine, dearly beloved
sinners, that God requires of you to labour for a long time before he grants you pardon: as
soon as you wish for forgiveness, he is ready to give it. Behold what the Scripture says:
” **_Weeping, thou shalt not weep, he will surely have pity on thee."_** (Isa. xxx. 19.) You shall not
have to weep for a long time: as soon as you shall have shed the tirst tear through sorrow for
your sins, God will have mercy on you. ” **_At the voice of thy cry, as soon as he shall hear, he
will answer thee."_** (Ibid.) **_The moment he shall hear you say: Forgive me, my God, forgive me,
he will instantly answer and grant your pardon._**


**SERMON XXXIII. FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - DEATH IS CERTAIN
AND UNCERTAIN.**
**_Let down your nets for a draught." LUKE v. 4._**


IN this day’s gospel we find that, having gone up into one of the ships, and having heard
from St. Peter, that he and his companions had laboured all the night and had taken nothing,
Jesus Christ said: **_"Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."_** They
obeyed; and having cast out their nets into the sea, they took such a multitude of fishes, that
the nets were nearly broken. Brethren, God has placed us in the midst of the sea of this life,
and has commanded us to cast out our nets, that we may catch fishes; that is, that we may
perform good works, by which we can acquire merits for eternal life. Happy we, if we attain
this end and save our souls! Unhappy we, if, instead of laying up treasures for heaven, we by
our sins merit hell, and bring our souls to damnation! Our happiness or misery for eternity
depends on the moment of our death, which is certain and uncertain. The Lord assures us
that death is certain, that we may prepare for it; but, on the other hand, he leaves us



uncertain as to the time of our death, that we may be always prepared for it two points of the
utmost importance.
**_First Point. It is certain that we shall die.
Second Point. It is uncertain when we shall die._**


**_First Point. It is certain that we shall die._**
1. ” **_It is appointed unto men once to die."_** (Heb. ix. 27.) The decree has been passed for each
of us: wo must all die. St. Cyprian says, that we are all born with the halter on the neck:
hence, every step we make brings us nearer to the gibbet. For each of us the gibbet shall be
the last sickness, which will end in death. As then, brethren, your name has been inserted in
the registry of baptism, so it shall be one day written in the record of the dead. As, in
speaking of your ancestors, you say: God be merciful to my father, to my uncle, or to my
brother; so others shall say the same of you when you shall be in the other world; and as you
have often heard the death-bell toll for many, so others shall hear it toll for you.



2. All things future, which regard men now living, are uncertain, but death is certain. **_"All
other goods and evils,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_are uncertain; death only is certain."_** It is
uncertain whether such an infant shall be rich or poor, whether he shall enjoy good or ill
health, whether he shall die at an early or at an advanced age. But it is certain that he shall
die, though he be son of a peer or of a monarch. And, when the hour arrives, no one can
resist the stroke of death. The same St. Augustine says: **_"Fires, waters, and the sword are
resisted; kings are resisted: death comes; who resists it ?"_** (in Ps. xii.) We may resist
conflagrations, inundations, the sword of enemies, and the power of princes; but who can
resist death? A certain king of France, as Belluacensis relates, said in his last moments:
**_"Behold, with all my power, I cannot make death wait for a single hour."_** No; when the term
of life has arrived, death does not wait even a moment”Thou hast appointed his bounds,
which cannot be passed." (Job. xiv. 5.)


3. We must all die. This truth we not only believe, but see with our eyes. In every age houses,
streets, and cities are filled with new inhabitants: their former possessors are shut up in the
grave. And, as for them the days of life are over, so a time shall come when not one of all who
are now alive shall be among the living. **_"Days shall be formed, and no one in them."_** (Ps.
cxxxviii. 10.) **_"Who is the man that shall live, and shall not see death ?"_** (Ps. lxxxviii. 49 )
Should any one flatter himself that he will not die, he would not only be a disbeliever for it is
of faith that we shall all die but he would be regarded as a madman. We know that all men,
even potentates and princes and emperors, have, utter a certain time, fallen victims to death.
And where are they now?” **_Tell me,"_** says St. Bernard, **_"where are the lovers of the world?
Nothing has remained of them but ashes and worms." Of_** so many great men of the world,
though buried in marble mausoleums, nothing has remained but a little dust and a few
withered bones. We know that our ancestors are no longer among the living: of their death
we are constantly reminded by their pictures, their memorandum books, their beds, and by
the clothes which they have left us. And can we entertain a hope or a doubt that we shall not
die? Of all who lived in this town a hundred years ago how many are now alive? They are all
in eternity in an eternal day of delights, or in an eternal night of torments. Either the one or
the other shall be our lot also.





4. But, God! we all know that we shall die: the misfortune is, that we imagine death as distant
as if it were never to come, and therefore we lose sight of it. But, sooner or later, whether we
think or think not of death, it is certain, and of faith that we shall die, and that we are
drawing nearer to it every day. ” **_For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is
to come."_** (Heb. xiii. 14.) This is not our country: here we are pilgrims on a journey. ” **_While
we are in the body we are absent from the Lord."_** (2 Cor. v. 6.) Our country is Paradise, if we
know how to acquire it by the grace of God and by our own good works. Our house is not
that in which we live; we dwell in it only in passing; our dwelling is in eternity. “ **_Man shall
go into the house of his eternity."_** (Eccl. xii. 5.) How great would be the folly of the man, who,
in passing through a strange country, should lay out all his property in the purchase of
houses and possessions in a foreign land, and reduce himself to the necessity of living
miserably for the remainder of his days in his own country! And is not he, too, a fool, who
seeks after happiness in this world, from which he must soon depart; and, by his sins,
exposes himself to the danger of misery in the next, where he must live for eternity?


5. Tell me, beloved brethren, if, instead of preparing for his approaching death, a person
condemned to die were, on his way to the place of execution, to employ the few remaining
moments of his life in admiring the beauty of the houses as he passed along, in thinking of
balls and comedies, in uttering immodest words, and detracting his neighbours, would you
not say that the unhappy man had either lost his reason, or that he was abandoned by God?
And are not you on the way to death? Why then do you seek only the gratification of the
senses? Why do you not think of preparing the accounts which you shall one day, and
perhaps very soon, have to render at the tribunal of Jesus Christ? Souls that have faith, leave
to the fools of this world the care of realizing a fortune on this earth; seek you to make a
fortune for the next life, which shall be eternal. The present life must end, and end very soon.


6. Go to the grave in which your relatives and friends are buried. Look at their dead bodies:
each of them says to you: **_"Yesterday for me; Today for thee."_** (Eccl. xxxviii. 23.) What has
happened to me must one day happen to thee. Thou shalt .become dust and ashes, as I am.
And where shall thy soul be found, if, before death, thou hast not settled thy accounts with
God? Ah, brethren! if you wish to live well, and to to have you accounts ready for that great
day, on which your doom to eternal life or to eternal death must be decided, endeavour,
during the remaining days of life, to live with death before your eyes. ” **_death, thy sentence is
welcome."_** (Eccl. xli. 3.) Oh! how correct are the judgments, how well directed the actions, of
those who form their judgments, and perform their actions, with death before their view! The
remembrance of death destroys all attachment to the goods of this earth. ” **_Let the end of life
be considered, ”_** says St. Lawrence Justinian, ” **_and there will be nothing in this world to be
loved."_** (de Ligno Vitæ, cap. v.) Yes; all the riches, honours, and pleasures of this world are
easily despised by him who considers that he must soon leave them forever, and that he shall
be thrown into the grave to be the food of worms.


7. Some banish the thought of death, as if, by avoiding to think of death, they could escape it.
But death cannot be avoided; and they who banish the thought of it, expose themselves to
great danger of an unhappy death. By keeping death before their eyes, the saints have
despised all the goods of this earth. Hence St. Charles Borromeo kept on his table a death’s
head, that he might have it continually in view. Cardinal Baronius had the words, **_“Memento
mori”Remember death"_** inscribed on his ring. The venerable P. Juvenal Anzia, Bishop of



Saluzo, had before him a skull, on which was written, **_"As I am, so thou shalt be."_** In retiring
to deserts and caves the holy solitaries brought with them the head of a dead man; and for
what purpose? To prepare themselves for death. Thus a certain hermit being asked at death,
why he was so cheerful, answered: **_I have kept death always before my eyes; and therefore,
now that it has arrived, I feel no terror._** But, oh! how full of terror is death, when it comes to
those who have thought of it but seldom.


**_Second Point. It is uncertain when we shall die._**


8. ”Nothing," says the Idiota, ”is more certain than death, but nothing is more uncertain than
the hour of death." It is certain that we shall die. God has already determined the year, the
month, the day, the hour, the moment, in which each of us shall leave this earth, and enter
into eternity; but this moment he has resolved not to make known to us. **_And justly,_** says St.
Augustine, **_has the Lord concealed it; for, had he manifested to all the day fixed for their
death, many should be induced to continue in the habit of sin by the certainty of not dying
before the appointed day. ”Si statuisset viam omnibus, faceret abundare peccata de
securitate”_** (in Ps. cxliv). Hence the holy doctor teaches that **_God has concealed from us the
day of our death, that we may spend all our days well. ”Latet ultimus dies, ut observentur
omnes dies. ”_** (Hom. xii. inter 50.) Hence Jesus Christ says: “ **_Be you also ready; for at what
hour you think not the Son of Man will come."_** (Luke xii. 40.) That we may be always
prepared to die, he wishes us to be persuaded that death will come when we least expect it.
” **_Of death,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_we are uncertain, that we may be found always prepared for
death."_** St. Paul likewise admonishes us that the day of the Lord that is, the day on which the
Lord shall judge us shall come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night, ” **_The day of the Lord
shall so come as a thief in the night." (_** 1 Thess. v. 2.) Since, then, says St. Bernard, death may
assail you and take away your life in every place and at every time, you should, if you wish
to die well and to save your soul, b **_e at all times and places in expectation of death: ”Mors
ubique te expectat tu ubique earn expectabis :"_** and St. Augustine says **_: ”Latet ultimus dies,
ut observentur omnes dies. ”_** (Hom, xii.) **_The Lord conceals from us the last day of our life,
that we may always have ready the account which we must render to God after death._**



9. Many Christians are lost, because many, even among the old, who feel the approach of
death, flatter themselves that it is at a distance, and that it will not come without giving them
time to prepare for it. ” **_Dura mente,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_abesse longe mors creditur etiam cum
sentitur." (Moral, lib. 8.) Death, even when it is felt, is believed to be far off._** O brethren, are
these your sentiments? How do you know that your death is near or distant? What reason
have you to suppose that death will give you time to prepare for it? How many do we know
who have died suddenly? Some have died walking; some sitting; and some during sleep. Did
any one of these ever imagine that he should die in such a manner? But they have died in this
way; and if they were in enmity with God, what has been the lot of their unhappy souls?
Miserable the man who meets with an unprovided death! And I assert, that all who
ordinarily neglect to unburthen their conscience, die without preparation, even though they
should have seven or eight days to prepare for a good death; for as I shall show in the forty-
fourth sermon, it is very difficult, during these days of confusion and terror, to settle accounts
with God, and to return to him with sincerity. But I repeat that death may come upon you in
such a manner, that you shall not have time even to receive the sacraments. And who knows
whether, in another hour, you shall be among the living or the dead? The uncertainty of the



time of his death made Job tremble. **_"For I knew not how long I shall continue, or whether,
after a while, my Maker may take me away."_** (Job xxxii. 22.) Hence St. Basil exhorts **_us in
going to bed at night, not to trust that we shall see the next day. ”Cum in lectulum ad
quicscendum membra tua posueris, noli confidere de lucis adventu."_** (Inst. ad fil. spirit.)



10. Whenever, then, the devil tempts you to sin, by holding out the hope that you will go to
confession and repair the evil you have done, say to him in answer: **_How do I know that this
shall not be the last day of my life? And should death overtake me in sin, and not give me
time to make my confession, what shall become of me for all eternity?_** Alas! how many poor
sinners have been struck dead in the very act of indulging in some sinful pleasure, and have
been sent to hell! **_"As fishes are taken by the hook, and as birds are caught with the snare, so
men are taken in the evil time."_** (Eccl. ix. 12.) Fishes are taken with the hook while they eat
the bait that conceals the hook, which is the instrument of their death. The evil time is
precisely that in which sinners are actually offending God. In the act of sin, they calm their
conscience by a security of afterwards making a good confession, and reversing the sentence
of their damnation. But death comes suddenly upon them, and does not leave them time for
repentance. **_"For, when they shall say peace and security, then shall sudden destruction come
upon them."_** (1 Thess. v. 3.)


11. If a person lend a sum of money he is careful instantly to get a written acknowledgment,
and to take all the other means necessary to secure the repayment of it. Who, he says, can
know what shall happen? Death may come, and I may lose my money. And how does it
happen that there are so many who neglect to use the same caution for the salvation of their
souls, which is of far greater importance than all temporal interests? "Why do they not also
say: Who knows what may happen? death may come, and I may lose my soul? If you lose a
sum of money, all is not lost; if you lose it one way you may recover the loss in another; but
he that dies and loses his soul, loses all, and has no hope of ever recovering it. If we could die
twice, we might, if we lost our soul the first time, save it the second. But we cannot die twice.
” **_It is appointed unto men once to die,"_** (Heb. ix. 27) Mark the word once: death happens to
each of us but once: he who has erred the first time has erred for ever. Hence, to bring the
soul to hell is an irreparable error. ” **_Periisse semel æternum est."_**


12. The venerable Father John Avila was a man of great sanctity, and apostle of Spain. What
was the answer of this great servant of God, who had led a holy life from his childhood,
when he was told that his death was at hand, and that he had but a short time to live?” **_Oh!"_**
replied the holy man with trembling, ” **_that I had a little more time to prepare for death!”St.
Agatho, abbot, after spending so many years in penance, trembled at the hour of death, and
said: ”What shall become of me? who can know the judgments of God ?"_** And, O brethren,
what will you say when the approach of death shall be announced to you, and when, from
the priest who attends you, you shall hear these words: ” **_Go forth, Christian soul, from this
world ?"_** You will, perhaps, say: Wait a little; allow me to prepare better. No; depart
immediately; death does not wait. You should therefore prepare yourselves now. ” **_With fear
and trembling work out your salvation."_** (Phil. ii. 12.) St. Paul admonishes us that, if we wish
to save our souls, we must live in fear and trembling, lest death may find us in sin. Be
attentive, brethren: there is question of eternity. ” **_If a tree fall to the south or to the north, in
what place soever it shall fall there shall it be."_** (Eccl. xi. 3.) If, when the tree of your life is
cut down, you fall to the south that is, if you obtain eternal life how great shall be your joy at



being able to say: I shall be saved; I have secured all; I can never lose God; I shall be happy
for ever. But, if you fall to the north that is, into eternal damnation how great shall be your
despair! Alas! you shall say, I have erred, and my error is irremediable! Arise, then, from
your tepidity, and, after this sermon, make a resolution to give yourselves sincerely to God.
This resolution will insure you a good death, and will make you happy for eternity.


**SERMON XXXIV. FIFTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE SIN OF ANGER.**
**_"Whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment." MATT. v. 2._**


ANGER resembles fire; hence, as fire is vehement in its action, and, by the smoke which it
produces, obstructs the view, so anger makes men rush into a thousand excesses, and
prevents them from seeing the sinfulness of their conduct, and thus exposes them to the
danger of the judgment of eternal death. **_“Whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in
danger of the judgment."_** Anger is so pernicious to man that it even disfigures his
countenance. No matter how comely and gentle he may be, he shall **_, as often as he yields to
the passion of anger, appear to be a monster and a wild beast full of terror. ”Iracundus,"
says St. Basil, ”humanam quasi liguram amittit, ferae specimen indutus."_** (Hom, xxi.) But, if
anger disfigures us before men, how much more deformed will it render us in the eyes of
God! In this discourse I will show, in the first point, the destruction which anger unrestrained
brings on the soul; and, in the second, how we ought to restrain anger in all occasions of
provocation which may occur to us.


**_First Point. The ruin which anger unrestrained brings on the soul._**


1. St. Jerome **_says that anger is the door by which all vices enter the soul. ”Omnium vitiorum
jantia est iracundia."_** (Inc. xxix. Prov.) Anger precipitates men into resentments,
blasphemies, acts of injustice, detractions, scandals, and other iniquities; for the passion of
anger darkens the understanding, and makes a man act like a beast and a madman.
” **_Caligavit ab indignatione oculus meus." (Job xvii. 7.) My eye has lost its sight through
indignation._** David said: ” **_My eye is troubled with wrath."_** (Ps. xxx. 10.) Hence, according to
St. Bonaventure, **_an angry man is incapable of distinguishing between what is just and
unjust. ”Iratus non potest videre quod justum est vel injustum."_** In a word, St. Jerome says
that **_anger deprives a man of prudence, reason, and understanding. ”Ab omni concilio
deturpat, ut donee irascitur, insanire credatur."_** Hence St. James says: ” **_The anger of man
worketh not the justice of God."_** (St. James i. 20.) The acts of a man under the influence of
anger cannot be conformable to the divine justice, and consequently cannot be faultless.



2. A man who does not restrain the impulse of anger, easily falls into hatred towards the
person who has been the occasion of his passion. According to St. Augustine, **_hatred is
nothing else than persevering anger. “Odium est ira diuturno tempore perseverans."_** Hence
St. Thomas says that” **_anger is sudden, but hatred is lasting. ”_** (Opusc. v.) It appears, then, that
in him in whom anger perseveres hatred also reigns. But some will say: I am the head of the
house; I must correct my children and servants, and, when necessary, I must raise my voice
against the disorders which I witness. I say in answer: It is one thing to be angry against a
brother, and another to be displeased at the sin of a brother. To be angry against sin is not
anger, but zeal; and therefore it is not only lawful, but is sometimes a duty. But our anger
must be accompanied with prudence, and must appear to be directed against sin, but not



against the sinner; for, if the person whom we correct perceive that we speak through passion
and hatred towards him, the correction will be unprofitable and even mischievous. To be
angry, then, against a brother’s sin is certainly lawful. ” **_He,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_is not angry
with a brother who is angry against a brother‟s sin." It is thus, as David said, we may be
angry without sin. ”Be ye angry, and sin not."_** (Ps. iv. 5.) But, to be angry against a brother on
account of the sin which he has committed is not lawful; because, according to St. Augustine,
**_we are not allowed to hate others for their vices. ”Nee propter vitia (licet) homines odisse_** "
(in Ps. xcviii).



3. Hatred brings with it a desire of revenge; for, according to St. Thomas, **_anger, when fully
voluntary, is accompanied with a desire of revenge. ”Ira est appetitus vindicteo."_** But you
will perhaps say: If I resent such an injury, God will have pity on me, because I have just
grounds of resentment Who, I ask, has told you that you have just grounds for seeking
revenge? It is you, whose understanding is clouded by passions, that say so. I have already
said that anger obscures the mind, and takes away our reason and understanding. As long as
the passion of auger lasts, you will consider your neighbour’s conduct very unjust and
intolerable; but, when your anger shall have passed away, you shall see that his act was not
so bad as it appeared to you. But, though the injury be grievous, or even more grievous, God
will not have compassion, on you if you seek revenge. No, he says: vengeance for sins
belongs not to you, but to me; and when the time shall come I will chastise them as they
deserve. ” **_Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time."_** (Deut. xxxii. 35.) If you resent
an injury done to you by a neighbour, God will justly inflict vengeance on you for all the
injuries you have offered to him, and particularly for taking revenge on a brother whom he
commands you to pardon. ” **_He that seeketh to revenge himself, shall find vengeance from the
Lord .... Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of God? .... He that is but flesh
nourisheth anger; and doth he ask forgiveness of God? Who shall obtain pardon for his sins
?"_** (Eccl. xxviii. 1, 3, 5.) Man, a worm of flesh, reserves anger, and takes revenge on a brother:
does he afterwards dare to ask mercy of God? And who, adds the sacred writer **_, can obtain
pardon for the iniquities of so daring a sinner? “Qua ironte,"_** says St. Augustine,
” **_indulgentiam peccatorem obtinere poterit, qui præcipienti dare veniam non acquiescit."_**
How can he who will not obey the command of God to pardon his neighbour, expect to
obtain from God the forgiveness of his own sins?


4. Let us implore the Lord to preserve us from yielding to any strong passion, and
particularly to anger. "Give me not over to a shameful and foolish mind." (Eccl. xxiii. 6.) For,
he that submits to such a passion is exposed to great danger of falling into a grievous sin
against God or his neighbour. How many, in consequence of not restraining anger, break out
into horrible blasphemies against God or his saints! But, at the very time we are in a flame of
indignation, God is armed with scourges. The Lord said one day to the Prophet Jeremias:
**_"What seest thou, Jeremias? And I said: I see a rod watching. ” (Jer. i. 11.) Lord, I behold a
rod watching to inflict punishment. ”_** The Lord asked him again: **_"What seest thou? And I
said: I see a boiling caldron."_** (Ibid., v. 13.). The boiling chaldron is the figure of a man
inflamed with wrath, and threatened with a rod, that is, with the vengeance of God. Behold,
then, the ruin which anger unrestrained brings on man. It deprives him, first, of the grace of
God, and afterwards of corporal life. ” **_Envy and anger shortens a man‟s days."_** (Eccl. xxx. 26.)
Job says: ” **_Anger indeed killeth the foolish."_** (Job v. 2.) All the days of their life, persons



addicted to anger are unhappy, because they are always in a tempest. But let us pass to the
second point, in which I have to say many things which will assist you to overcome this vice.


**_Second Point. How we ought to restrain anger in the occasions of provocation which occur
to us._**



5. In the first place it is necessary to know that it is not possible for human weakness, in the
midst of so many occasions, to be altogether free from every motion of anger. **_“No one, ”_** as
Seneca says, **_“can be entirely exempt from this passion. ” “Iracundia nullum genus hominum
excipit"_** (I. 3, c. xii). All our efforts must be directed to the moderation of the feelings of anger
which spring up in the soul. How are they to be moderated? By meekness. This is called the
virtue of the lamb that is, the beloved virtue of Jesus Christ. Because, like a lamb, without
anger or even complaint, he bore the sorrows of his passion and crucifixion. ” **_He shall be led
as a sheep to the slaughter, and dumb as a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open his
mouth."_** (Isa. liii. 7.) Hence he has taught us to learn of him meekness and humility of heart.
” **_Learn of me, because I am meek and humble of heart."_** (Matt. xi. 29)


6. Oh! how pleasing in the sight of God are the meek, who submit in peace to all crosses,
misfortunes, persecutions, and injuries! To the meek is promised the kingdom of heaven.
” **_Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the land."_** (Matt. v. 4.) They are called the
children of God. ” **_Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of God. ”_**
(Ibid., v. 9.) Some boast of their meekness, but without any grounds; for they are meek only
towards those who praise and confer favours upon them: but to those who injure or censure
them they are all fury and vengeance. The virtue of meekness consists in being meek and
peaceful towards those who hate and maltreat us. “ **_With them, that hated peace I was
peaceful."_** (Ps. cxix. 7.)


7. We must, as St. Paul says, put on the bowels of mercy towards all men, and bear one with
another. **_"Put on ye the bowels of mercy, humility, modesty, patience, bearing with one
another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another."_** (Col iii. 12, 13.)
You wish others to bear with your defects, and to pardon your faults; you should act in the
same manner towards them. Whenever, then, you receive an insult from a person enraged
against you , remember that a **_"mild answer breaketh wrath,"_** (Prov. xv. 1.) A certain monk
once passed through a cornfield: the owner of the field ran out, and spoke to him in very
offensive and injurious language. The monk humbly replied: Brother, you are right; I have
done wrong; pardon me. By this answer the husbandman was so much appeased that he
instantly became calm, and even wished to follow the monk, and to enter into religion. The
proud make use of the humiliations they receive to increase their pride; but the humble and
the meek turn the contempt and insults offered to them into an occasion of advancing in
humility. **_"He,"_** says St. Bernard, ” **_is humble who converts humiliation into humility."_** (Ser.
xxiv. in Can.)


8. **_"A man of meekness,"_** says St. Chrysostom, **_"is useful to himself and to others."_** The meek
are useful to themselves, because, according to F. Alvares, the time of humiliation and
contempt is for them the time of merit. Hence, Jesus Christ calls his disciples happy when
they shall be reviled and persecuted. **_"Blessed are ye when they shall revile you and
persecute you."_** (Matt. v. 11.) Hence, the saints have always desired to be despised as Jesus



Christ has been despised. The meek are useful to others; because, as the same St. Chrysostom
says, **_there is nothing better calculated to draw others to God, than to see a Christian meek
and cheerful when he receives an injury or an, insult. ”Nihil ita conciliat Domino familiares
ut quod ilium vident mansuetudine jucundum."_** The reason is, because virtue is known by
being tried; and, as gold is tried by fire, so the meekness of men is proved by humiliation.
**_“Gold and silver are tried in the fire, but acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation. ”_**
(Eccl. ii. 5.)” **_My spikenard, ”_** says the spouse in the Canticles, **_“sent forth the odour thereof"_** (i.
11.) The spikenard is an odoriferous plant, but diffuses its odours only when, it is torn and
bruised. In this passage the inspired writer gives us to understand, that a man cannot be said
to be meek unless he is known to send forth the odour of his meekness by bearing injuries
and insults in peace and without anger. God wishes us to be meek even towards ourselves.
When a person commits a fault, God certainly wishes him to humble himself, to be sorry for
his sin, and to purpose never to fall into it again but he does not wish him to be indignant
with himself, and give way to trouble and agitation of mind; for, while the soul is agitated, a
man is incapable of doing good. ” **_My heart is troubled; my strength hath left me."_** (Ps. xxx
vii. 11.)



9. Thus, when we receive an insult, we must do violence to ourselves in order to restrain
anger. Let us either answer with meekness, as recommended above, or let us remain silent;
and thus, as St. Isidore says, we shall conquer. **_"Quamvis quis irritet, tu dissimula, quia
tacendo vinces."_** But, if you answer through passion, you shall do harm to yourselves and
others. **_It would be still worse to give an angry answer to a person who corrects you.
”Medicanti irascitur,"_** says St. Bernard, ” **_qui non irascitur sagittanti."_** (Ser. vi. de Nativ.)
Some are not angry, though they ought to be indignant with those who wound their souls by
flattery; and are filled with indignation against the person who censures them in order to
heal their irregularities. Against the man who abhors correction, the sentence of perdition
has, according to the Wise Man, been pronounced. **_"Because they have despised all my
reproofs,... .the prosperity of fools shall destroy them."_** (Prov. i. 30, etc.) Fools regard as
prosperity to be free from correction, or to despise the admonitions which they receive; but
such prosperity is the cause of their ruin. When you meet with an occasion of anger, you
must, in the first place, be on your guard not to allow anger to enter your heart. **_“Be not
quickly angry”_** (Eccles. vii. 10.) Some persons change colour, and get into a passion, at every
contradiction: and when anger has got admission, God knows to what it shall lead them.
Hence, it is necessary to foresee these occasions in our meditations and prayers; for, unless
we are prepared for them, it will be as difficult to restrain anger as to put a bridle on a horse
while running away.


10. Whenever we have the misfortune to permit anger to enter the soul, let us be careful not
to allow it to remain. Jesus Christ tells all who remember that a brother is offended with
them, not to offer the gift which they bring to the altar without being first reconciled to their
neighbour. ” **_Go first to be reconciled to thy brother, and then coming thou shalt offer thy
gift."_** (Matt. v. 24.) And he who has received any offence, should endeavour to root out of his
heart not only all anger, but also every feeling of bitterness towards the persons who have
offended him. **_“Let all bitterness,"_** says St. Paul, **_"and anger and indignation be put away
from you."_** (Eph. iv. 31.) As long as anger continues, follow the advice of Seneca” **_When you
shall be angry do nothing, say nothing, which may be dictated by anger."_** Like David, be
silent, and do not speak, when you feel that you are disturbed. ” **_I was troubled, and I spoke_**



**_not."_** (Ps. Ixxvi. 5.) How many when inflamed with anger, say and do what they afterwards,
in their cooler moments, regret, and excuse themselves by saying that they were in a passion?
As long, then, as anger lasts we must be silent, and abstain from doing or resolving to do
anything; for, what is done in the heat of passion will, according to the maxim of St. James, be
unjust. ” **_The anger of man worketh not the justice of God."_** (i. 20.) It is also necessary to
abstain altogether from consulting those who might foment our indignation**_. "Blessed,"_** says
David, **_"is the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly."_** (Ps. i. 1.) To him
who is asked for advice, Ecclesiasticus says. **_"If thou blow the spark, it shall burn as a fire;
and if thou spit upon it, it shall be quenched."_** (Eccl. xxviii. 14.) When a person is indignant at
some injury which he has received, you may, by exhorting him to patience, extinguish the
fire; but, if you encourage revenge, you may kindle a great flame. Let him, then, who feels
himself in any way inflamed with anger, be on his guard against false friends, who, by an
imprudent word, may be the cause of his perdition.



11. Let us follow the advice of the apostle: ” **_Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by
good."_** (Hom, xii. 21.) **_"Be not overcome by evil:"_** do not allow yourself to be conquered by
sin. If, through anger, you seek revenge or utter blasphemies, you are overcome by sin. But
you will say: **_"I am naturally of a warm temper."_** By the grace of God, and by doing violence
to yourself, you will be able to conquer your natural disposition. Do not consent to anger,
and you shall subdue the warmth of your temper. But you say: ” **_I cannot bear with unjust
treatment."_** In answer I tell you, first, to remember that anger obscures reason, and prevents
us from seeing things as they are. **_"Fire hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun."_**
(Ps. lvii. 9.) Secondly, if you return evil for evil, your enemy shall gain a victory over you.
” **_If,"_** said David, ” **_I have rendered to them that repaid me evils, let me deservedly fall empty
before my enemies."_** (Ps. vii. 5.) If I render evil for evil, I shall be defeated by my enemies.
” **_Overcome evil by good. ”_** Render every foe good for evil. ” **_Do good,"_** says Jesus Christ, **_"to
them that hate you."_** (Matt. v. 44.) This is the revenge of the saints, and is called by St.
Paulinus, Heavenly revenge. It is by such revenge that you shall gain the victory. And should
any of those, of whom the Prophet says, ” **_The venom, of asps is under their lips_** " (Ps. cxxxix.
4), ask how you can submit to such an injury, let your answer be: **_"The chalice which my
Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?"_** (John xviii. 11.) And then turning to God you
shall say: ” **_I opened not my mouth, because thou hast done it"_** (Ps. xxxviii. 10), for it is certain
that every cross which befalls you comes from the Lord. **_“Good things and evil are from
God."_** (Eccl xi. 14.) Should any one take away your property, recover it if you can; but if you
cannot, say with Job: ” **_The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away"_** (i. 21.) A certain
philosopher, who lost some of his goods in a storm, said: ” **_If 1 have lost my goods I will not
lose my peace."_** And, do you say: If I have lost my property, I will not lose my soul.


12. In fine, when we meet with crosses, persecutions, and injuries, let us turn to God, who
commands us to bear them with patience; and thus we shall always avoid anger. **_"Remember
the fear of God, and be not angry with thy neighbour."_** (Eccl. xxviii. 8.) Let us give a look at
the will of God, which disposes things in this manner for our merit, and anger shall cease. Let
us give a look at Jesus crucified, and we shall not have courage to complain. St. Eleazar being
asked by his spouse how he bore so many injuries without yielding to anger, answered: **_I
turn to Jesus Christ, and thus I preserve my peace._** Finally, let us give a glance at our sins, for
which we have deserved far greater contempt and chastisement, and we shall calmly submit
to all evils. St. Augustine says, that **_though we are sometimes innocent of the crime for which_**



**_we are persecuted, we are, nevertheless, guilty of other sins which merit greater punishment
than that which we endure. "Esto non habemus peccatum, quod objicitur: habemus tamen,
quod digne in nobis flagelletur."_** (in Ps. Ixviii.)


**SERMON XXXV. SIXTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE VANITY OF THE
WORLD.**
**_"And have nothing to eat." MARK viii. 2._**



1. SUCH were the attractions of our Divine Saviour, and such the sweetness with which he
received all, that he drew after him thousands of the people. Ho one day saw himself
surrounded by a great multitude of men, who followed him and remained with him three
days, without eating anything. Touched with pity for them, Jesus Christ said to his disciples:
” **_I have compassion on the multitude; for behold they have now been with me three days, and
have nothing to eat."_** (Mark viii. 2.) He, on this occasion, wrought the miracle of the
multiplication of the seven loaves and a few fishes, so as to satisfy the whole multitude. This
is the literal sense; but the mystic sense is, that in this world there is no food which can fill the
desire of our souls. All the goods of this earth riches, honours, and pleasures delight the
sense of the body, but cannot satiate the soul, which has been created **_" for God, and which
God alone can content. ”_** I will, therefore speak Today on the vanity of the world, and will
show how great is the illusion of the lovers of the world, who lead an unhappy life on this
earth, and expose themselves to the imminent danger of a still more unhappy life in eternity.


2. **_“O ye sons of men,"_** exclaims the Royal Prophet, against worldlings, ” **_how long will you be
dull at heart? Why do you love vanity and seek after lying ?"_** (Ps. iv. 3.) O men, fools, how
long will you fix the affections of your hearts on this earth? why do you love the goods of this
world, which are all vanity and lies? Do you imagine that you shall find peace by the
acquisition of these goods? But how can you expect to find peace, while you walk in the ways
of affliction, and misery? Behold how David describes the condition of worldlings.
” **_Destruction and unhappiness in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known."_**
(Ps. xiii. 3.) You hope to obtain peace from the world; but how can the world give you that
peace which you seek, when St. John says, ” **_that the whole world is seated in wickedness ?"_**
(1 John v. 19.) The world is full of iniquities; hence worldlings live under the despotism of the
wicked one that is, the Devil. The Lord has declared that there is no peace for the wicked who
live without his grace. ” **_There is no peace to the wicked."_** (Isa. xlviii. 22 .)


3. The goods of the world are but apparent goods, which cannot satisfy the heart of man.
**_"You have eaten,"_** says the Prophet Aggeus, ” **_and have not had enough."_** (Ag. i. 6) Instead of
satisfying our hunger they increase it. ” **_These,"_** says St. Bernard, **_"provoke rather than
extinguish hunger."_** If the goods of this work! made men content, the rich and powerful
should enjoy complete happiness; but experience shows the contrary. We see every day that
they are the most unhappy of men; they appear always oppressed by fears, by jealousies and
sadness. Listen to King Solomon, who abounded in these goods: ” **_And behold all is vanity
and vexation of spirit."_** (Eccl. i. 14.) He tells us, that all things in this world are vanity, lies,
and illusion. They are not only vanity, but also affliction of spirit. They torture the poor soul,
which finds in them a continual source, not of happiness, but of affliction and bitterness. This
is a just punishment on those who instead of serving their God with joy, wish to serve their
enemy the world which makes them endure the want of every good. ” **_Because thou didst not_**



**_serve the Lord thy God with joy and gladness of heart thou shaft serve thy enemy in hunger,
and thirst, and nakedness, and in want of all things. ”_** (Deut. xxviii. 47, 48.) Man expects to
content his heart with the goods of this earth; but, howsoever abundantly he may possess
them, he is never satisfied. Hence, he always seeks after more of them, and is always
unhappy. Oh! happy he who wishes for nothing but God; for God will satisfy all the desires
of his heart. **_"Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart."_** (Ps. xxxvi.
4.) Hence St. Augustine asks: **_“What, miserable man, dost thou seek in seeking after goods?
Seek one good, in which are all goods."_** And, having dearly learned that the goods of this
world do not content, but rather afflict the heart of man, the saint, turning to the Lord, said:
**_"All things are hard, and thou alone repose_** ." Hence in saying, **_"My God and my all,"_** the
seraphic St. Francis, though divested of all worldly goods, enjoyed greater riches and
happiness than an the worldlings on this earth. Yes; for the peace which fills the soul that
desires nothing but God, surpasses all the delights which creatures can give. They can only
delight the senses, but cannot content the heart of man. **_"The peace of God which surpasseth
all understanding."_** (Phil. iv. 7.) According to St. Thomas, **_the difference between God, the
sovereign good, and the goods of the earth, consists in this, that he more perfectly we possess
God, the more ardently we love him, because the more perfectly we possess him, the better
we comprehend his infinite greatness, and therefore the more we despise other things; but,
when we possess temporal goods, we despise them, because we see their emptiness, and
desire other things, which may make us content. "Summum bonum quanto perfectius
possidetur, tanto magis amatur, et alia contemnuntur. Sed in appetitu temporalium
bonorum, quando habentur, contemnentur, et alia appetuntur."_** (S. Thom, i. 2, qu. 2, art. 1, ad.
3.)



4. The Prophet Osee tells us that the world holds in its hand a deceitful balance. ” **_He is like
Chanaan" (that is the world); "there is a deceitful balance in his hand."_** (Osee xii. 7.) We
must, then, weigh things in the balance of God, and not in that of the world, which makes
them appear different i rom what they are. What are the goods of this life?” **_My days, ”_** said
Job, **_"have been swifter than a post: they have passed by as ships carrying fruits."_** (Job ix. 25,
26.) The ships signify the lives of men, which soon pass away, and run speedily to death; and
if men have laboured only to provide themselves with earthly goods, these fruits decay at the
hour of death: we can bring none of them with us to the other world. We, says St. Ambrose,
**_falsely call these things our property, which we cannot bring witli us to eternity, where we
must live for ever, and where virtue alone will accompany us. "Non nostra sunt, quæ non
possumus auferre nobiscum: sola virtus nos comitatur."_** You, says St. Augustine, **_attend only
to what a rich man possessed; but tell me, which of his possessions shall he, now that he is
on the point of death, be able to take with him?”Quid hie habebat attendis, quid secum fert,
atteudo ?"_** (Serm. xiii. de Adv. Dom.) The rich bring with them a miserable garment, which
shall rot with them in the grave. And should they, during life, have acquired a great name,
they shall be soon forgotten. ”Their memory hath perished with a noise." (Ps. ix. 7.)


5. Oh! that men would keep before their eyes that great maxim of Jesus Christ” **_What doth it
profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and suffer the loss of his own soul ?"_** (Matt. xvi. 26.)
If they did, they should certainly cease to love the world. What shall it profit them at the hour
of death to have acquired all the goods of this world, if their souls must go into hell to be in
torments for all eternity? How many has this maxim, sent into the cloister and into the
desert? How many martyrs has it encouraged to embrace torments and death! In the history



of England, we read of thirty kings and queens, who left the world and became religious, in
order to secure a happy death. The consideration of the vanity of earthly goods made St.
Francis Borgia retire from the world. At the sight of the Empress Isabella, who had died in
the flower of youth, he came to the resolution of serving God alone. **_"Is such, then,"_** he said,
” **_the end of all the grandeur and crowns of this world? Henceforth I will serve a master who
can never die."_** The day of death is called” **_the day of destruction" ("The day of destruction is
at hand”_** (Deut. xxxii. 35), because on that day we shall lose and give up all the goods of the
world all its riches, honours, and pleasures. The shade of death obscures all the treasures and
grandeurs of this earth; it obscures even the purple and the crown. Sister Margaret of St.
Anne, a Discalced Carmelite, and daughter of the Emperor Rodolph the Second, used to say:
” **_What do kingdoms profit us at the hour of death ?" "The affliction of an hour maketh one
forget great delights."_** (Eccl. xi. 29.) The melancholy hour of death puts an end to all the
delights and pomps of this life. St. Gregory says, **_that all goods which cannot remain with us,
or which are incapable of taking away our miseries, are deceitful. ”Fallaces sunt que
nobiscum permanere non possunt: fallaces sunt que mentis nostræ inopiam non expellunt."_**
(Hom. xv. in Luc.) Behold a sinner whom the riches and honours which he had acquired
made an object of envy to others. Death came upon him when he was at the summit of his
glory, and he is no longer what he was. **_"I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted up
like the cedars of Libanus; and I passed by, and lo! he was not; and I sought him, and his
place was not found."_** (Ps. xxxvi. 35, 38.)



6. These truths the unhappy damned fruitlessly confess in hell, where they exclaim with
tears: **_“What hath pride profited us? or what advantage hath the boasting of riches brought
us? All those things are passed away like a shadow."_** (Wis. v. 8, 9.) What, they say, have our
pomps and riches profited us, now that they are all passed away like a shadow, and for us
nothing remains but eternal torments and despair? Dearly beloved Christians, let us open our
eyes, and now that we have it in our power, let us attend to the salvation of our souls; for, if
we lose them, we shall not be able to save them in the next life. Aristippus, the philosopher,
was once shipwrecked, and lost all his goods; but such was the esteem which the people
entertained for him on account of his learning, that, as soon as he reached the shore, they
presented him with an equivalent for all that he had lost. He then wrote to his friends, and
exhorted them to attend to the acquisition of goods which cannot be lost by shipwreck. Our
relatives and friends who have passed into eternity exhort us, from the other world, to labour
in this life for the attainment of goods which are not lost at death. If at that awful moment we
shall be found to have attended only to the accumulation of earthly goods, we shall be called
fools, and shall receive the reproach addressed to the rich man in the gospel, who, after
having reaped an abundant crop from his fields, said to himself: **_“Soul, thou hast much goods
laid up for many years; take thy rest, eat, drink, make good cheer. But, God said to him: Thou
fool, this night do they require thy soul of thee: and whose shall those things be which thou
hast provided ?"_** (Luke xii. 19,20.) He said, ” **_they require thy soul of thee,"_** because to
everyman his soul is given, not with full power to dispose of it as he pleases, but it is given to
him in trust, that he may preserve and return it to God in a state of innocence, when it shall
be presented at the tribunal of the Sovereign Judge. The Redeemer concludes this parable by
saying: ” **_So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God"_** (v. 21).
This is what happens to those who seek to enrich themselves with the goods of this life, and
not with the love of God. Hence St. Augustine asks: ” **_What has the rich man if he has not
charity? If the poor man has charity, what is there that he has not ?"_** He that possesses all



the treasures of this world, and has not charity, is the poorest of men; but the poor who have
God possess all things, though they should be bereft of all earthly goods.



7. **_“The children of this world,“_** says Jesus Christ, ” **_are wiser in their generation than the
children of light."_** (Luke xvi. 8.) how wise in earthly affairs are worldlings, who live in the
midst of the darkness of the world! **_"Behold,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_how much men suffer for
things for which they entertain a vicious love."_** "What fatigue do they endure for the
acquisition of property, or of a situation of emolument! With what care do they endeavour to
preserve their bodily health! They consult the best physician, and procure the best medicine.
And Christians, who are the children of light, will take no pains, will suffer nothing, to secure
the salvation of their souls! God! at the light of the candle which lights them to death, at that
hour, at that time, which is called the time of truth, worldlings shall see and confess their
folly. Then each of them shall exclaim: that I had led the life of a saint! At the hour of death,
Philip the Second, King of Spain, called in his son, and having shown him his breast
devoured with worms, said to him: **_Son, behold how we die; behold the end of all worldly
greatness._** He then ordered a wooden cross to be fastened to his neck; and, having made
arrangements for his death, he turned again to his son, and said: **_My son, I wished you to be
present at this scene, that you might understand how the world in the end treats even
monarchs. He died saying: Oh, that I had been a lay brother in some religious order, and that
I had not been a king!_** Such is the language at the hour of death, even of the princes of the
earth, whom worldlings regard as the most fortunate of men. But these desires and sights of
regret serve only to increase the anguish and remorse of the lovers of the world at the hour of
death, when the scene is about to close.


8. And what is the present life but a scene, which soon passes away for ever? It may end
when we least expect it. Cassimir, King of Poland, while he sat at table with his grandees,
died in the act of raising a cup to take a draught; thus the scene ended for him. The Emperor
Celsus was put to death in seven days after his election; and the scene closed for him.
Ladislaus, King of Bohemia, in his eighteenth year, while he was preparing for the reception
of his spouse, the daughter of the King of France, was suddenly seized with a violent pain,
which took away his life. Couriers were instantly despatched to announce to her that the
scene was over for Ladislaus, that she might return to France. **_“The world,"_** says Cornelius à
Lapide, in his comment upon this passage, **_"is like a stage. One generation passes away, and
a new generation comes. The king does not take wiih him the purple. Tell me, villa, O house,
how many masters had you ?"_** In every age the inhabitants of this earth are changed. Cities
and kingdoms are filled with new people. The first generation passes to the other world, a
second comes on, and this is followed by another. He who, in the scene of this world, has
acted the part of a king is no longer a king. The master of such a villa or palace is no longer its
master. Hence the Apostle gives us the following advice: **_“The time is short; it remaineth
that... they that use this world be as if they used it not; for the fashion of this world passeth
away."_** (I Cor. vii. 29, 30.) Since the time of our dwelling on this earth is short, and since all
must end with our death, let us make use of this world to despise it, as if it did not exist for
us; and let us labour to acquire the eternal treasures of Paradise, where, as the Gospel says,
there are no moths to consume, nor thieves to steal them. ” **_But lay up to yourselves treasures
in heaven, where neither the rust nor the moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break
through nor steal."_** (Matt. vi. 20.) St. Teresa used to say: ” **_We should not set value on what
ends with life; the true life consists in living in such a manner as not to be afraid of death."_**



Death shall have no terror for him who, during life, is detached from the vanities of this
world, and is careful to provide himself only with goods which shall accompany him to
eternity, and make him happy for ever.


**SERMON XXXVI. SEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE EDUCATION
OF CHILDREN.**
**_"A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit."
MATT. vii. 18._**


THEN the gospel of this day tells us, that a good plant cannot produce bad fruit, and that a
bad one cannot produce good fruit. Learn from this, brethren, that a good father brings up
good children. But, if parents be wicked, how can the children be virtuous? Have you ever,
says the Redeemer, in the same gospel, seen grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from
thistles? **_“Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles ?"_** (v. 16.) And, in like
manner, it is impossible, or rather very difficult, to find children virtuous, who are brought
up by immoral parents. Fathers and mothers, be attentive to this sermon, which is of great
importance to the eternal salvation of yourselves and of your children. Be attentive, young
men and young women, who have not as yet chosen a state of life. If you wish to marry, learn
this day the obligations which you can contract with regard to the education of your children;
and learn also that, if you do not fulfil them, you shall bring yourselves and all your children
to damnation. I shall divide this sermon into two points. In the first, I shall show how
important it is to bring up children in habits of virtue; and in the second, I shall show with
what care and diligence a parent ought to labour to bring them up well.


**_First Point. How very important it is to bring up children in habits of virtue._**



1. A father owes two obligations to his children; he is bound to provide for their corporal
wants, and to educate them in habits of virtue. It is not necessary at present to say more on
the first obligation, than that there are some fathers more cruel than the most ferocious of
wild beasts; for these do not forget to nourish their offspring; but certain parents squander
away in eating and drinking, and gaming, all their property, or all the fruits of their industry,
and allow their children to die of hunger. But let us come to the education, which is the
subject of my discourse.


2. It is certain that a child’s future good or ill conduct depends on his being brought up well
or ill. Nature itself teaches every parent to attend to the education of his offspring. He who
has given them being ought to endeavour to make life useful to them. God gives children to
parents, not that they may assist the family, but that they may be brought up in the fear of
God, and be directed in the way of eternal salvation. ” **_We have,"_** says St. Chrysostom, ” **_a
great deposit in children; let us attend to them with great care."_** (Hom, ix., in 1 ad Tit.)
Children have not been given to parents as a present, which they may dispose of as they
please, but as a trust, for which, if lost through their negligence, they must render an account
to God. The Scripture tells us, that when a father observes the divine law, both he and his
children shall prosper. **_"That it may be well with thee and thy children after thee, when thou
shalt do that which is pleasing in the sight of God."_** (Deut. xii. 25.) The good or ill conduct of
a parent may be known, by those who have not witnessed it, from the life which his children
lead. **_"For by the fruit the tree is known. ”_** (Matt. xii. 33.)” **_A father, ”_** says Ecclcsiasticus, ” **_who_**



**_leaves a family, when he departs this life, is as if he had not died; because his sons remain,
and exhibit his habits and character. His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead; for
he hath left one behind him that is like himself."_** (Eccl. xxx. 4.) When we find a son addicted
to blasphemies, to obscenities, and to theft, we have reason to suspect that such too was the
character of the father. ” **_For a man is known by his children."_** (Eccl. xi. 30.)



3. Hence Origen says, that **_on the day of judgment parents shall have to render an account for
all the sins of their children. “Omnia quæcumque delinquerint filii, a parentibus requiruntur.
”_** (Grig., Lib. 2, in Job.) Hence, he who teaches his son to live well, shall die a happy and
tranquil death. ”He that teacheth his son ...when he died he was not sorrowful, neither was
he confounded." (Eccl. xxx. 3, 5.) And he shall save his soul by means of his children; that is,
by the virtuous education which he has given them. ” **_She shall be saved through child-
bearing."_** (1 Tim. ii. 15.) But, on the other hand, a very uneasy and unhappy death shall be the
lot of those who have laboured only to increase the possessions, or to multiply the honours of
their family; or who have sought only to lead a life of ease and pleasure, but have not
watched over the morals of their children. St. Paul says, that such parents are worse than
infidels. “ **_But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he
hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."_** (1 Tim. v. 8.) "Were fathers or mothers to
lead a life of piety and continual prayer, and to communicate every day, they should be
damned if they neglected the care of their children. "Would to God that certain parents paid
as much attention to their children as they do to their horses! How careful are they to see that
their horses are fed and well trained! And they take no pains to make their children attend at
catechism, hear mass, or go to confession. **_"We take more care”_** says St. Chrysostom, **_"of our
asses and horses, than of the children. ”_** (Hom, x., in Matt.)


4. If all fathers fulfilled their duty of watching over the education of their children, we should
have but few crimes and few executions. **_By the bad education which parents give to their
offspring, they cause their children,_** says St. Chrysostom, **_to rush into many grievous vices;
and thus they deliver them up to the hands of the executioner. ”Majoribus illos malis
involvimus, et carnificum manibus damus."_** (Serin, xx., de divers.) Hence, in Lacedemon, a
parent, as being the cause of all the irregularities of his children, was justly punished for their
crimes with greater severity than the children themselves. Great indeed is the misfortune of
the child that has vicious parents, who are incapable of bringing up their children in the fear
of God, and who, when they see their children engaged in dangerous friendships and in
quarrels, instead of correcting and chastising them, rather take compassion on them, and say **_:
”What can be done? They are young; they must take their course."_** Oh! what wicked maxims!
what a cruel education! Do you hope that when your children grow up they shall become
saints? Listen to what Solomon says **_: ”A young man, according to his way, even when he is
old, he will not depart from it."_** (Prov. xxii. 6.) A young man who has contracted a habit of
sin will not abandon it even in his old age**_. ”His bones," says Job, ”shall be filled with the
vices of his youth, and they shall sleep with him in the dust."_** (Job xx. 11.)


When a young person has lived in evil habits, his bones shall be filled with the vices of his
youth, so that he will carry them with him to death; and the impurities, blasphemies, and
hatred to which he was accustomed in his youth, shall accompany him to the grave, and shall
sleep -with him after his bones shall be reduced to dust and ashes. It is very easy, when they
are small, to train up children to habits of virtue; but, when they have come to manhood, it is



equally difficult to correct them, if they have learned habits of vice. But, let us come to the
second point that is, to the means of bringing up children in the practice of virtue. I entreat
you, fathers and mothers, to remember what I now say to you; for on it depends the eternal
salvation of your own souls, and of the souls of your children.


**_Second Point. On the care and diligence with which parents ought to endeavour to bring up
their children in habits of virtue._**



5. St. Paul teaches sufficiently, in a few words, in what the proper education of children
consists. He says that it consists in discipline and correction. **_"And you, fathers, provoke not
your children to anger; but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord."_**
(Ephes. vi. 4 ) **_Discipline,_** which is the same as the religious regulation of the morals of
children, implies an obligation of educating them in habits of virtue by word and example.
First, by words: a good father should often assemble his children, and instil into them the
holy fear of God. It was in this manner that Tobias brought up his little son. The father taught
him from his childhood to fear the Lord and to fly from sin. ” **_And from his infancy he taught
him to fear God and to abstain from sin. ”_** (Tob. i. 10.) The Wise Man says that a well
educated son is the support and consolation of his father. "Instruct thy son, and he shall
refresh thee, and shall give delight to thy soul." (Prov. xxix. J7.) But, as a well instructed son is
the delight of his father’s soul, so an ignorant child is a source of sorrow to a father’s heart;
for the ignorance of his obligations as a Christian is always accompanied with a bad life.


Cantipratensis relates (lib. 1, cap. 20) that, in the year 1248, an ignorant priest was
commanded, in a certain synod, to make a discourse. But while he was greatly agitated by
the command, the devil appeared to him, and instructed him to say: ” **_The rectors of infernal
darkness salute the rectors of parishes, and thank them for their negligence in instructing the
people; because from ignorance proceed the misconduct and the damnation of many."_** The
same is true of negligent parents. **_In the first place, a parent ought to instruct his children in
the truths of faith, and particularly in the four principal mysteries. First, that there is but
one God, the Creator, and Lord of all things; secondly, that this God is a remunerator, who,
in the next life, shall reward the good with the eternal glory of Paradise, and shall punish the
wicked with the everlasting torments of hell; thirdly, the mystery of the holy Trinity that is,
that in God there are Three Persons, who are only one God, because they have but one
essence; fourthly, the mystery of the incarnation of the Divine Word the Son of God, and true
God, who became man in the womb of Mary, and suffered and died for our salvation._**


Should a father or a mother say: I myself do not know these mysteries, can such an excuse be
admitted? that is, can one sin excuse another? If you are ignorant of these mysteries you are
obliged to learn them, and afterwards teach them to your children. At least, send your
children to the catechism. Oh! what a misery to see so many fathers and mothers who are
unable to instruct their children in the most necessary truths of faith, and who, instead of
sending their sons and daughters to the Christian doctrine on festivals, employ them in
messages, or other occupations of little moment; and when grown up they know not what is
meant by mortal sin, by hell, or eternity. They do not even know the Creed, the Pater Noster,
or the Hail Mary, which every Christian is bound to learn under pain of mortal sin.


6. Religious parents not only instruct their children in these things, which are the most
important, but they also teach them the acts which ought to be made every morning after



rising. They teach them, first, to thank God for having preserved their life during the night;
secondly, to offer to God all the good actions which they will perform, and all the pains
which they shall suffer during the day; thirdly, to implore of Jesus Christ and most holy
Mary to preserve them from all sin during the day. They teach them to make every evening
an examen of conscience and an act of contrition. They also teach them to make every day the
acts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, to recite the Rosary, and to visit the Blessed Sacrament.
Some good fathers of families are careful to get a book of meditations read, and to have
mental prayer in common for half an hour every day. This is what the Holy Ghost exhorts
you to practise. "Hast thou children? Instruct them and bow down their neck from their
childhood." (Eccl. vii. 25.) Endeavour to train them from their infancy to these religious
hahits, and when they grow up they shall persevere in them. Accustom them also to go to
confession and communion every week. Be careful to make them go to confession when they
arrive at the age of seven, and to communion at the age of ten. This is the advice of St.
Charles Borromeo. As soon as they attain the use of reason make them receive the sacrament
of confirmation.



7. It is also very useful to infuse good maxims into the infant minds of children. Oh! what
ruin is brought upon his children by the father who teaches them worldly maxims!” **_You
must,"_** some people say to their children, ” **_seek the esteem and applause of the world. God is
merciful; he takes compassion on certain sins."_** Miserable the young man who sins in
obedience to such maxims. Good parents teach very different maxims to their children.
Queen Blanche, the mother of St. Louis, King of France, used to say to him: “ **_My son, I would
rather see you dead in my arms than in the state of sin."_**


Oh! brethren, let it be your practice also to infuse into your children certain maxims of
salvation, such as, **_“What will it profit us to gain the whole world, if we lose our own souls?
Every thing on this earth has an end; but eternity never ends. Let all be lost, provided God is
not lost."_** One of these maxims well impressed on the mind of a young person will preserve
him always in the grace of God.


8. But parents are obliged to instruct their children in the practice of virtue, not only by
words, but still more by example. If you give your children bad example, how can you expect
that they will lead a good life? When a dissolute young man is corrected for a fault, he
answers: Why do you censure me, when my father does worse. **_"The children will complain
of an ungodly father, because for his sake they are in reproach. ”(_** Eccl. xli. 10.) How is it
possible for a son to be moral and religious, when he has had the example of a father who
was accustomed to utter blasphemies and obscenities; who spent the entire day in the tavern,
in gaming and drunkenness; who was in the habit of frequenting houses of bad fame, and of
defrauding his neighbour? Do you expect that your son will go frequently to confession,
when you yourself approach the tribunal of penance scarcely once a year? Children are like
apes; they do what they see their parents do. It is related in the fables, that a crab-fish one day
rebuked its young for walking crookedly. They replied: Father, let us see you walk. The
father walked before them more crookedly than they did. This is what happens to the parent
who gives bad example. Hence, he has not even courage to correct his children for the sins
which he himself commits.





9. But though he should correct them, by words, of what use is his correction when he sets
them a bad ex ample by his acts? It has been said in the council of Bishops, that” **_men believe
the eyes rather than the ears."_** And St. Ambrose says: ” **_The eyes convince me of what they see
more quickly than the ear can insinuate what is past."_** (Serm. xxiii., de S. S.) According to St.
Thomas, scandalous parents compel, in a certain manner, their children to lead a bad life.
” **_Eos ad peccatum, quantum in eis fuit obligaverunt"_** (in Ps. xvi). They are not, says St.
Bernard, **_fathers, but murderers; they kill, not the bodies, but the souls of their children. "Non
parentes, sed peremptores."_** It is useless for them to say: ” **_My children have been born with
bad dispositions."_** This is not true; for, as Seneca says **_, ”you err, if you think that vices are
born with us; they have been engrafted."_** (Ep. xciv.) Vices are not born with your children, but
have been communicated to them by the bad example of the parents. If you had given good
example to your sons, they should not be so vicious as they are. **_O brethren, frequent the
sacraments, assist at sermons, recite the Rosary every day, abstain from all obscene
language, from, detraction, and from quarrels; and you shall see that your sons will go often
to confession, will assist at sermons, will say the Rosary, will speak modestly, and will fly
from detraction and disputes._** It is particularly necessary to train up children to virtue in their
infancy: ” **_Bow down their neck from their childhood ;"_** for when they have grown up and
contracted bad habits, it will be very difficult for you to produce, by words, any amendment
in their lives.


10. To bring up children in the discipline of the Lord, it is also necessary to take away from
them the occasion of doing evil. Hence a father must, in the first place, forbid his children to
go out at night, or to go to a house in which their virtue might be exposed to danger, or to
keep bad company. ” **_Cast out,"_** said Sarah to Abraham, ” **_this bondwoman and her son."_**
(Gen. xxi. 10.) She wished to have Ishmael, the son of Agar the bondwoman, banished from
her house, that her son Isaac might not learn his vicious habits. Bad companions are the ruin
of young persons. A father should not only remove the evil which he witnesses, but he is also
bound to inquire after the conduct of his children, and to seek information from domestics
and from externs regarding the places which his sons frequent when they leave home,
regarding their occupations and companions.


Secondly, he should take from them every musical instrument which is to them an occasion
of going out at night, and all forbidden weapons which may lead them into quarrels or
disputes. Thirdly, he should dismiss all immoral servants; and, if his sons be grown up, he
should not keep in his house any young female servant. Some parents pay little attention to
this; and when the evil happens they complain of their children, as if they expected that tow
thrown into the fire should not burn. Fourthly, a father ought to forbid his children ever to
bring into his house stolen goods such as fowl, fruit, and the like. When Tobias heard the
bleating of a goat in his house, he said: **_"Take heed, lest perhaps it be stolen; restore ye it to
its owners."_** (Tob. li. 21.) How often does it happen that, when a child steals something, the
mother says to him: ” **_Bring it to me, my son."_** Parents should prohibit to their children all
games which bring destruction on their families and on their own souls, and also masks,
scandalous comedies, and certain, dangerous conversations and parties of pleasure. Fifthly, a
father should remove from his house romances, which pervert young persons, and all bad
books which contain pernicious maxims, tales of obscenity, or of profane love.





Sixthly, he ought not to allow his children to sleep in his own bed, nor the males and females
to sleep together. Seventhly, he should not permit his daughters to be alone with men,
whether young or old. But some will say: ”Such a man teaches my daughters to read and
write, etc.; he is a saint." The saints are in heaven; but the saints that are on earth are flesh,
and by proximate occasions they may become devils. Eighthly, if he has daughters, he should
not permit young men to frequent his house. To get their daughters married, some mothers
invite young men to their houses. They are anxious to see their daughters married; but they
do not care to see them in sin. These are the mothers who, as David says, immolate their
daughters to the devil. ” **_They sacrifice their sons and their daughters to devils."_** (Ps. cv. 37.)
And to excuse themselves they will say: ” **_Father, there is no harm in what I do."_** There is no
harm! Oh! how many mothers shall we see condemned on the day of judgment on account of
their daughters! The conduct of such mothers is at least a subject of conversation among their
neighbours and equals; and, for all, the parents must render an account to God. O fathers and
mothers! confess all the sins you have committed in this respect, before the day on which you
shall be judged arrives.



11. Another obligation of parents is, to correct the faults of the family. **_"Bring them up in the
discipline and correction of the Lord. ”_** There are fathers and mothers who witness faults in
the family, and remain silent. A certain mother was in the habit of acting in this manner. Her
husband one day took a stick and began to beat her severely. She cried out, and said: **_"I am
doing nothing. Why do you beat me ?" "I beat you, ”replied the husband, ”because you see,
and do not correct, the faults of the children because you do nothing."_** Through fear of
displeasing their children some fathers neglect to correct them; but, if you saw your son
falling into a pool of water, and in danger of being drowned, would it not be savage cruelty
not to catch him by the hair and save his life?” **_He that spareth the rod hateth his son."_** (Prov.
xiii. 24.) If you love your sons correct them, and, while they are growing up chastise them,
even with the rod, as often as it may be necessary. I say, ” **_with the rod,"_** but not with the
stick; for you must correct them like a father, and not like a galley sergeant. You must be
careful not to beat them when you are in a passion; for, you shall then be in danger of beating
them with too much severity, and the correction will be without fruit; for they then believe
that the chastisement is the effect of anger, and not of a desire on your part to see them
amend their lives. I have also said that you should correct them **_“while they are growing up ;"_**
for, when they arrive at manhood, your correction will be of little use. You must then abstain
from correcting them with the hand; otherwise, they shall hecome more perverse, and shall
lose their respect for you. But of what use is it to correct children by so many injurious words
and by so many imprecations? Deprive them of some part of their meals, of certain articles of
dress, or shut them up in a room. But I have said enough. Dearly beloved brethren, draw
from the discourse which you have heard the conclusion, that he who has brought up his
children badly shall be severely punished; and that he who has trained them to habits of
virtue shall receive a great reward.


**SERMON XXXVII. EIGHTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE PARTICULAR
JUDGMENT.**
**_“Give an account of thy stewardship." LUKE xvi. 2._**


BELOVED Christians, of all the goods of nature, of fortune, and of grace, which we have
received from God, we are not the masters, neither can we dispose of them as we please; we



are but the administrators of them; and therefore we should employ them according to the
will of God, who is our Lord. Hence, at the hour of death, we must render a strict account of
them to Jesus Christ, our Judge. ”For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of
Christ, that every one may receive the proper things of the body as he hath done, whether it
be good or evil." (2 Cor. v. 10.) This is the precise meaning of that”give an account of thy
stewardship," in the gospel of this day. ”You are not," says St. Bonaventure, in his comment
on these words, ”a master, but a steward over the things committed to you; and therefore
you are to render an account of them." I will place before your eyes Today the rigour of this
judgment, which shall be passed on each of us on the last day of our life. Let us consider the
terror of the soul, first, when we shall be presented to the Judge; secondly, when she shall be
examined; and thirdly, when she shall be condemned.


**_First Point. Terror of the soul when she shall be presented to the Judge._**


1. **_"It is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment."_** (Heb. ix. 27.) It is of
faith that we shall die, and that after death a judgment shall be passed on all the actions of
our life. Now, what shall be the terror of each of us when we shall be at the point of death,
and shall have before our eyes the judgment which must take place the very moment the soul
departs from the body? Then shall be decided our doom to eternal life, or to eternal death. At
the time of the passage of their souls from this life to eternity, the sight of their past sins, the
rigour of God’s judgment, and the uncertainty of their eternal salvation, have made the saints
tremble. St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzia trembled in her sickness, through the fear of
judgment; and to her confessor, when he endeavoured to give her courage, she said: **_"Ah!
father, it is a terrible thing to appear before Christ in judgment."_** After spending so many
years in penance in the desert, St. Agatho trembled at the hour of death, and said: ” **_What
shall become of me when I shall be judged ?"_** The venerable Father Louis da Ponte was seized
with such a fit of trembling at the thought of the account which he should render to God, that
he shook the room in which he lay. The thought of judgment inspired the venerable Juvenal
Ancina, Priest of the Oratory, and afterwards Bishop of Saluzzo, with the determination to
leave the world. Hearing the Dies Iræ sung, and considering the terror of the soul when
presented before Jesus Christ, the Judge, he took, and afterwards executed, the resolution of
giving himself entirely to God.



2. It is the common opinion of theologians, that at the very moment and in the very place in
which the soul departs from the body, the divine tribunal is erected, the accusation is read,
and the sentence is passed by Jesus Christ, the Judge. At this terrible tribunal each of us shall
be presented to give an account of all our thoughts, of all our words, and of all our actions.
**_"For we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may
receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil."_** (
2 Cor. v. 10.) When presented before an earthly judge criminals have been seen to fall into a
cold sweat through fear. It is related of Piso, that so great and insufferable was the confusion,
which he felt at the thought of appearing as a criminal before the senate that he killed
himself. How great is the pain of a vassal, or of a son, in appearing before an angry prince or
an enraged father, to account for some crime which he has committed! Oh! how much greater
shall be the pain and confusion of the soul in standing, before Jesus Christ enraged against
her for having despised him during her life! Speaking of judgment, St. Luke says: **_"Then you
shall see the Son of Man."_** (Luke xxi. 27.) They shall see Jesus Christ as man, with the same



wounds with which he ascended into heaven. **_"Great joy of the beholders!"_** says Robert the
Abbot, **_"a great terror of those who are in expectation!"_** These wounds shall console the just,
and shall terrify the wicked. In them sinners shall see the Redeemer’s love for themselves,
and their ingratitude to him.


3. **_"Who,"_** says the Prophet Nahum, **_"can stand before the face of his indignation ?"_** (i. 6.)
How great, then, shall be the terror of a soul that finds herself in sin before this Judge, the
first time she shall see him, and see him full of wrath! St. Basil says **_that she shall be tortured
more by her shame and confusion than by the very fire of hell. ”Horridior quam ignis, erit
pudor."_** Philip the Second rebuked one of his domestics for having told him a lie**_. ”Is it thus,"
said the king to him, ”you deceive me?"_** The domestic, after having returned home, died of
grief. The Scripture tells us, that when Joseph reproved his brethren, saying: ” **_I am Joseph,
whom you sold," they were unable to answer through fear, and remained silent. ”His
brethren could not answer him, being struck with exceeding great fear."_** (Gen. xlv. 3.) Now
what answer shall sinners make to Jesus Christ when he shall say to them: I am your
Redeemer and your Judge, whom you have so much despised. Where shall the miserable
beings fly, says St. Augustine, when they shall see an angry Judge above, hell open below, on
one side their own sins accusing them, and on the other the devils dragging them to
punishment, and their conscience burning them within? “ **_Above shall be an enraged Judge
below, a horrid chaos on the right, sins accusing him on the left, demons dragging him to
punishment within, a burning conscience! Whither shall a sinner, beset in this manner, fly
?"Perhaps he will cry for mercy? But how, asks Eusebius Emissenus, can he dare to implore
mercy, when he must first render an account of his contempt for the mercy which Jesus Christ
has shown to him?”With what face will you, who are to be first judged for contempt of
mercy, ask for mercy?"_** But let us come to the rendering of the accounts.


**_Second Point. Terror of the soul when she shall be examined._**



4. As soon as the soul shall be presented before the tribunal of Jesus Christ, he will say to her:
” **_Give an account of thy stewardship:"_** render instantly an account of thy entire life. The
Apostle tells us, that to be worthy of eternal glory our lives must be found conformable to the
life of Jesus Christ. ” **_For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to
the image of his son ;...them he also glorified."_** (Rom. viii. 29, 30.) Hence St. Peter has said,
that in the judgment of Jesus Christ, the just man who has observed the divine law, has
pardoned enemies, has respected the saints, has practised chastity, meekness, and other
virtues, shall scarcely be saved. ” **_The just man shall scarcely be saved."_** The Apostle adds:
"Where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear ?" (1 Pet. iv. 18.) What shall become of the
vindictive and the unchaste, of blasphemers and slanderers? What shall become of those
whose entire life is opposed to the lite of Jesus Christ?


5. In the first place, the Judge shall demand of sinners an account of all the blessings and
graces which he bestowed on them in order to bring them to salvation, and which they have
rendered fruitless. He will demand an account of the years granted to them that they might
serve God, and which they have spent in offending him. "He hath called against me the
time." (Lam. i. 15.) He will then demand an account of their sins. Sinners commit sins, and
afterwards forget them; but Jesus Christ does not forget them: he keeps, as Job says, all our
iniquities numbered, as it were in a bag. **_“Thou hast sealed up my iniquities, as it were in a_**



**_bag."_** (Job xiv. 17.) And he tells us that, on the day of accounts, he will take a lamp to
scrutinize all the actions of our life. ” **_And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
Jerusalem with lamps."_** (Soph. i. 12.) The lamp, says Mendoza on this passage, penetrates all
the corners of the house that is, God will discover all the defects of our conscience, great and
small. According to St. Anselm, an account shall be demanded of every glance of the eyes.
”Exigitur usque ad ictum oculi." And, according to St. Matthew, of every idle word. ” **_Every
idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it on the day of judgment."_**
(Matt. xii. 36.)



6. The Prophet Malachy says, that as gold is refined by taking away the dross, so on the day
of judgment all our actions shall be examined, and every defect which may be discovered
shall be punished. ” **_He shall purify the sons of Levi, and shall refine them as gold."_** (Mal. iii.
3.) Even our justices that is, our good works, confessions, communions, and prayers shall be
examined. **_"When I shall take a time, I will judge justices."_** (Ps. Ixxiv. 3.) But if every glance,
every idle word, and even good works, shall be judged, with what rigour shall immodest
expressions, blasphemies, grievous detractions, thefts, and sacrileges be judged? **_Alas! on
that day every soul shall, as St. Jerome says, see, to her own confusion, all the evils which
she has done. ”Videbit unusquisque quod fecit."_**


7. ” **_Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord. ”_** (Prov. xvi. 11.) In the balance of the Lord
a holy life and good works make the scale descend; but nobility, wealth, and science have no
weight. Hence, if found innocent, the peasant, the poor, and the ignorant shall be rewarded.
But the man of rank, of wealth, or of learning, if found guilty, shall be condemned. **_"Thou art
weighed in the balance," said Daniel to Belthassar, ”and art found wanting." (Dan. v.
27.)”Neither his gold nor his wealth," says Father Alvares, ”but the king alone was
weighed."_**


8. At the divine tribunal the poor sinner shall see himself accused by the devil, who,
according to St. Augustine, ” **_will recite the words of our profession, and will charge us before
our face with all that we have done, will state the day and hour in which we sinned."_** (Con.
Jud., tom. 6.)”He will recite the words of our profession" that is, he will enumerate the
promises which we have made to God, and which we afterwards violated. ” **_He will charge us
before our face ;"_** he will upbraid us with all our wicked deeds, pointing to the day and hour
in which they were committed. And he will, as the same saint says, conclude his accusation
by saying: **_"I have suffered neither stripes nor scourges for this man."_** Lord, I have suffered
nothing for this ungrateful sinner, and to make himself my slave he has turned his back on
thee who has endured so much for his salvation. He, therefore, justly belongs to me. Even his
angel-guardian will, according to Origen, come forward to accuse him, and will say: **_"I have
laboured so many years for his salvation; but he has despised all my admonitions."
"Unusquisque angelorum perhibet testimonium, quot annis circa eum laboraverit, sed ille
monita sprevit."_** (Hom. lxvi.) Thus, even friends shall treat with contempt the guilty soul.
” **_All her friends have despised her."_** (Lamen. i. 2.) Her very sins shall, says St. Bernard, accuse
her. **_“And they shall say: You have made us; we are your work; we shall not desert you."_**
(Lib. Medit, cap. ii.) We are your offspring; we shall not leave you: we shall be your
companions in hell for all eternity.





9. Let us now examine the excuses which the sinner will be able to advance. He will say, that
the evil inclinations of nature had drawn him into sin. But he shall be told that, if
concupiscence impelled him to sins, it did not oblige him to commit them; and that, if he had
recourse to God, he should have received from him grace to resist every temptation. For this
purpose Jesus Christ has left us the sacraments: but when we do not make use of them, we
can complain only of ourselves. **_"But, ”_** says the Redeemer, “ **_now they have no excuse for
their sin."_** (John xv. 22.) To excuse himself, the sinner shall also say that the devil tempted
him to sin. But, as St. Augustine says, **_"The enemy is bound like a dog in chains, and can bite
only him who has united himself to him with a deadly security."_** The devil can bark, but
cannot bite unless you adhere and listen to him. Hence the saint adds: ” **_See how foolish is the
man whom a dog, loaded with chains, bites."_** Perhaps he will advance his bad habits as an
excuse; but this shall not stand; for the same St. Augustine says, that though it is difficult to
resist the force of an evil habit, ” **_if any one does not desert himself, he will conquer it with the
divine assistance."_** If a man does not abandon himself to sin, and invokes God’s aid, he will
overcome evil habits. The Apostle tells us, that the Lord does not permit us to be tempted
above our strength. ” **_God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which
you are able."_** ( I Cor. x. 13.)


10. ” **_For what shall I do,"_** said Job, ” **_when God shall rise to judge me? and when he shall
examine, what shall I answer him”_** (Job xxxi. 14.) What answer shall the sinner give to Jesus
Christ? How can he, who sees himself so clearly convicted, give an answer? He shall be
covered with confusion, and shall remain silent, like the man found without the nuptial
garment. ” **_But he was silent."_** (Matt. xxii. 12.) His very sins shall shut the sinner’s mouth.
**_"And all iniquity shall stop her mouth."_** (Ps. cvi. 42.) There,, says St. Thomas of Villanova,
there shall be no intercessor to whom the sinner can have recourse. ” **_There, there is no
opportunity of sinning; there, no intercessor, no friend, no father shall assist."_** Who shall
then save you? Is it God? But how, asks St. Basil, can you expect salvation from him whom
you have despised?” **_Who shall deliver you? Is it God, whom you have insulted ?"_** (S. Bas.,
Or. 4, de Fen.) Alas! the guilty soul that leaves this world in sin, is condemned by herself
before the Judge pronounces sentence. Let us come to the sentence of the Judge.


**_Third Point. Terror of the soul when she shall be condemned._**


11. How great shall be the joy of a soul when, at death, she hears from Jesus Christ these
sweet words: ” **_Well done, good and faithful servant; because thou hast been faithful over a
few things, I will place thee over many things. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."_** (Matt.
xxv. 21.) Equally great shall be the anguish and despair of a guilty soul, that shall see herself
driven away by the Judge with the following words: ” **_Depart from me, you cursed, into
everlasting fire"_** (verse 41). Oh! what a terrible thunderclap shall that sentence be to her!” **_Oh!
how frightfully,"_** says the Carthusian, **_"shall that thunder resound!"_** Eusebius writes, that the
terror of sinners at hearing their condemnation shall be so great that, if they could, they
would die again. “ **_The wicked shall be seized with such terror at the sight of the Judge
pronouncing sentence that, if they were not immortal, they should die a second time."_** But,
brethren, let us, before the termination of this sermon, make some reflections which will be
profitable to us. St. Thomas of Villanova says, that **_some listen to discourses on the judgment
and condemnation of the wicked with as little concern as if they they themselves were secure
against these things, or as if the day of judgment were never to arive for them. "Heu quam_**



**_securi hæc dicimus et audimus, quasi nos non tangeret hæc sententia, aut quasi dies hæc
nunquam esset venturus!"_** (Conc, i., de Jud.) The saint then asks: Is it not great folly to
entertain security in so perilous an affair? **_"Quæ est ista stulta securitas in discrimine
tanto?"_** There are some, says St. Augustine, who, though they live in sin, cannot imagine that
God will send them to hell**_. ”Will God,"_** they say, ” **_really condemn us ?" Brethren, adds the
saint, do not speak thus. So, many of the damned did not believe that they should be sent to
hell; but the end came, and, according to the threat of Ezechiel, they have been cast into that
place of darkness. "The end is come, the end is come... and I will send my wrath upon thee,
and I will judge thee."_** (Ezec. vii. 2, 3.) Sinners, perhaps vengeance is at hand for you, and still
you laugh and sleep in sin. Who will not tremble at the words of the Baptist: ” **_For now the
axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree, therefore, that doth not yield good fruit shall be
cut down and cast into the fire."_** (Matt, iii. 10.) He says, that every tree that does not bring
forth good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire; and he promises that, with regard to
the trees, which represent sinners, the axe is already laid to the roots that is, chastisement is
at hand. Dearly beloved brethren, let us follow the counsel of the Holy Ghost **_"Before
judgment, prepare thee justice."_** (Eccl. xviii. 19.) Let us adjust our accounts before the day of
accounts. Let us seek God, now that we can find him; for the time shall come when we will
wish, but shall not be able to find him. ” **_You shall seek me, and shall not find me."_** (John vii.
36 .)” **_Before judgment,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_the Judge can be appeased, but not in judgment."_**
By a change of life we can now appease the anger of Jesus Christ, and recover his grace; but
when he shall judge, and find us in sin, he must execute justice, and we shall be lost.


**SERMON XXXVIII. NINTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE DEATH OF THE
SINNER.**
**_"Thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee." LUKE xix. 43._**


SEEING from a distance the city of Jerusalem, in which the Jews were soon to put him to
death, Jesus Christ wept over it. **_"Videns civitatern flevit super illam."_** Our merciful
Redeemer wept at the consideration of the chastisement which was soon to be inflicted on the
city, and which he foretold to her inhabitants. ” **_Thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee. ”_**
Unhappy city! thou shalt one day see thyself encompassed by enemies, who shall beat thee
flat to the ground, and thy children in thee, and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone.
Most beloved brethren, this unhappy city is a figure of the soul of a sinner, who, at the hour
of death, shall find himself surrounded by his enemies first, by remorse of conscience;
secondly, by the assaults of the devils; and thirdly, by the fears of eternal death.


**_First Point. The sinner at death shall be tortured by remorses of conscience._**



1. **_"Their soul shall die in a storm."_** (Job xxxvi. 14.) The unhappy sinners who remain in sin
die in a tempest, with which God has beforehand threatened them. ”A tempest shall break
out and come upon the head of the wicked." (Jer. xxiii. 19.) At the commencement of his
illness the sinner is not troubled by remorse or fear; because his relatives, friends, physicians,
and all tell him that his sickness is not dangerous; thus he is deceived and hopes to recover.
But when his illness increases, and malignant symptoms, the harbingers of approaching
death, begin to appear, then the storm with which the Lord has threatened the wicked shall
commence. **_"When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction as a tempest shall be
at hand."_** (Prov. i. 27.) This tempest shall be formed as well by the pains of sickness as by the



fear of being obliged to depart from this earth, and to leave all things; but still more by the
remorses of conscience, which shall place before his eyes all the irregularities of his past life.
” **_They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand
against them to convict them."_** (Wis. iv. 20.) Then shall his sins rush upon his mind, and fill
him with terror. His iniquities shall stand against him to convict him, and, without the aid of
other testimony, shall assail him, and prove that he deserves hell.



2. The dying sinner will confess his sins; but, according to St. Augustine, ” **_The repentance
which is sought from a sick man is infirm."_** (Serm, xxxvii., de Temp.) And St. Jerome says,
that **_of a hundred thousand sinners who continue till death in the state of sin, scarcely one
shall be saved. ”Vix de centum milibus, quorum mala vita fuit, meretur in morte a Deo
indulgentiam, unus."_** (Epis. de Mort. Eus.) St. Vincent Ferrer writes, that **_it is a greater
miracle to save such sinners, than to raise the dead to life. ”Majus miraculum est, quod male
viventes faciant bonum finem, quam suscitare mortuos."_** (Serm. i., de Nativ. Virgin.) They
shall feel convinced of the evil they have done; they will wish, but shall not be able, to detest
it. Antiochus understood the malice of his sins when he said: ” **_Now I remember the evils that
I have done in Jerusalem."_** (1 Mach. vi. 12.) He remembered his sins, but did not detest them.
He died in despair and oppressed with great sadness, saying: **_"Behold, I perish with great
grief in a strange land"_** (v. 13). According to St. Fulgentius, the same happened to Saul at the
hour of death: he remembered his sins **_; he dreaded the punishment which they deserved; but
he did not detest them. “Non odit quid fecerat, sed timuit quod nolebat."_**


3. Oh! how difficult is it for a sinner, who has slept many years in sin, to repent sincerely at
the hour of death, when his mind is darkened, and his heart hardened!” **_His heart shall be as
hard as a stone, and as firm as a smiths anvil."_** (Job xli. 15.) During life, instead of yielding to
the graces and calls of God, he became more obdurate, as the anvil is hardened by repeated
strokes of the hammer. ” **_A hard heart shall fare evil at the last."_** (Eccl. iii. 27.) By loving sin
till death, he has loved the danger of his damnation, and therefore God will justly permit him
to perish in the danger in which he wished to live till death.


4. St. Augustine says, **_that he who is abandoned by sin before he abandons it, will scarcely
detest it as he ought at the hour of death; for he will then detest it, not through a hatred of
sin, but through necessity. ”Qui prius a peccato relinquitur, quam ipse relinquat, non libere,
sed quasi ex necessitate condemnat."_** But how shall he be able to hate from his heart the sins
which he has loved till death? He must love the enemy whom till then he has hated, and he
must hate the person whom he has till that moment loved. Oh! what mountains must he
pass! He shall probably meet with a fate similar to that of a certain person, who kept in
confinement a great number of wild beasts in order to let them loose on the enemies who
might assail him. But the wild beasts, as soon as he unchained them, instead of attacking his
enemies, devoured himself. When the sinner will wish to drive away his iniquities, they shall
cause his destruction, either by complacency in objects till then loved, or by despair of
pardon at the sight of their numbers and enormity. **_"Evils shall catch the unjust man unto
destruction_** ." (Ps. cxxxix. 12.) St. Bernard says, that at death the sinner shall see himself
chained and bound by his sins. ” **_We are your works; we will not desert you." We_** will not
leave you; we will accompany you to judgment, and will be your companions for all eternity
in hell.





**_Second Point. The dying sinner shall be tortured by the assaults of the devils._**


5. ” **_The devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short
time."_** (Apoc. xii. 12.) At death the devil exerts all his powers to secure the soul that is about
to leave this world; for he knows, from the symptoms of the disease, that he has but little
time to gain her for eternity. **_The Council of Trent teaches that Jesus Christ has left us the
sacrament of Extreme Unction as a most powerful defence against the temptations of the
devil at the hour of death. “Extremæ Unctionis sacramento finem vitæ tanquam firmissimo
quodam præsidio munivit."_** And the holy council adds, **_that there is no time in which the
enemy combats against us with so much violence in order to effect our damnation, and to
make us despair of the divine mercy, as at the end of life. ”N ullum tempus est, quo
vehementius ille omnes suæ versutiæ nervos intendat at perendos, nos penitus, et a fiducia,
etiam, si possit, divinæ misericordiæ deturbandos, quam cum impendere nobis exitum vitæ
perspicet." (Sess. 14, cap. ix. Doctr. de Sacr. Extr. Unct.)_**



6. Oh! how terrible are the assaults and snares of the devil against the souls of dyiug persons,
even though they have led a holy life! After his recovery from a most severe illness, the holy
king Eleazar said, that the temptations by which the devil assails men at death, can be
conceived only by him who has felt them. We read in the life of St. Andrew Avelliuo, that in
his agony he had so fierce a combat with hell, that all the religious present were seized with
trembling. They perceived that, in consequence of the agitation, his face swelled, and became
black, all his members trembled, and a flood of tears gushed from his eyes. All began to weep
through compassion, and were rilled with terror at the sight of a saint dying in such a
manner. But they were afterwards consoled, when they saw that as soon as an image of most
holy Mary was held before him, he became perfectly calm, and breathed forth his blessed
soul with great joy.


7. Now, if this happens to the saints, what shall become of poor sinners, who have lived in sin
till death? At that awful moment the devil does not come alone to tempt them in a thousand
ways, in order to bring them to eternal perdition, but he calls companions to his assistance.
**_"Their house shall be filled with serpents."_** (Isa. xiii. 21.) When a Christian is about to leave
this world, his house is filled with devils, who unite together in order to effect his ruin. **_"All
her persecutors have taken her in the midst of straits."_** (Lamen. i. 3.) All his enemies will
encompass him in the straits of death. One shall say: **_Be not afraid; you shall not die of this
sickness!_** Another will say: **_You have been for so many years deaf to the calls of God, and can
you now expect that he will save you?_** Another will ask: **_How can you repair the frauds of
your past life, and the injuries you have done to your neighbour in his property and
character?_** Another shall ask: **_What hope can there be for you? Do you not see that all your
confessions have been null that they have been made without true sorrow, and without a
firm purpose of amendment? How can you repair them with this heart, which you feel so
hard? Do you not see that you are lost?_** And in the midst of these straits and attacks of
despair, the dying sinner, full of agitation and confusion, must pass into eternity. ” **_The people
shall be troubled and they shall pass."_** (Job xxxiv 20.)


**_Third Point. The dying sinner shall be tortured by the fears of eternal death._**


8. Miserable the sick man who takes to his bed in the state of mortal sin! He that lives in sin
till death shall die in sin. **_"You shall die in your sin."_** (John viii. 21.) It is true that, in



whatsoever hour the sinner is converted, God promises to pardon him; but to no sinner has
God promised the grace of conversion at the hour of death. ” **_Seek the Lord while he may be
found."_** (Isa. iv. 6.) Then, there is for some sinners a time when they shall seek God and shall
not find him. “ **_You shall seek me, and shall not find me."_** (John vii. 34.) The unhappy beings
will go to confession at the hour of death; they will promise and weep, and ask mercy of God,
but without knowing what they do. A man who sees himself under the feet of a foe pointing
a dagger to his throat, will shed tears, ask pardon, and promise to serve his enemy as a slave
during the remainder of his life. But, will the enemy believe him? No; he will feel convinced
that his words are not sincere that his object is to escape from his hands, and that, should he
be pardoned, he will become more hostile than ever. In like manner, how can God pardon the
dying sinner, when he sees that all his acts of sorrow, and all his promises, proceed not from
the heart, but from a dread of death and of approaching damnation.



9. In the recommendation of the departing soul, the assisting priest prays to the Lord, saying:
” **_Recognize, O Lord, thy creature."_** But God answers: I know that he is my creature; but,
instead of regarding me as his Creator, he has treated me as an enemy. The priest continues
his prayer, and says: ” **_Remember not his past iniquities. ”_** I would, replies the Lord, pardon
all the past sins of his youth; but he has continued to despise me till this moment the very
hour of his death. ” **_They have turned their back upon me, and not their face: and, in the time
of affliction, they will say: Arise, and deliver us. Where are the gods which thou hast made
thee? let them rise and deliver thee."_** (Jer. ii. 27, 28.) You, says the Lord, have turned your
back upon me till death; "and do you now want me to deliver you from vengeance? Invoke
your own gods the creatures, the riches, the friends you loved more than you loved me. Call
them now to come to your assistance, and to save you from hell, which is open to receive
you. It now justly belongs to me to take vengeance on the insults you have offered me. You
have despised my threats against obstinate sinners, and have paid no regard to them.
” **_Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide."_** (Deut. xxxii.
35.) The time of my vengeance is now arrived; it is but just to execute it.


This is precisely what happened to a certain person in Madrid, who led a wicked life, but, at
the sight of the unhappy death of a companion, went to confession, and resolved to enter a
strict religious order. But, in consequence of having neglected to put his resolution into
immediate execution, he relapsed into his former irregularities. Being reduced to great want,
he wandered about the world, and fell sick at Lima. From the hospital in which he took
refuge he sent for a confessor, and promised again to change his life, and to enter religion.
But, having recovered from his illness, he returned to his wickedness; and, behold! the
vengeance of God fell upon him. One day, his confessor, who was a missionary, in passing
over a mountain, heard a noise, which appeared to be the howling of a wild beast. He drew
near the place from which the noise proceeded, and saw a dying man, half rotten, and
howling through despair. He addressed to him some words of consolation. The sick man,
opening his eyes, recognized the missionary, and said: **_Have you, too, come to he a witness
of the justice of God? I am the man who made my confession in the hospital of Lima. I then
promised to change my life, but have not done so; and now I die in despair._** And thus the
miserable man, amid these acts of despair, breathed forth his unhappy soul. These facts are
related by Father Charles Bovio (part iii., example 9).





10. Let us conclude the discourse. Tell me, brethren, were a person in sin seized with
apoplexy, and instantly deprived of his senses, what sentiments of pity would you feel at
seeing him die in this state; without the sacraments, and without signs of repentance! Is not
he a fool, who, when he has time to be reconciled with God, continues in sin, or returns to his
sins, and thus exposes himself to the danger of dying suddenly, and of dying in sin? **_"At
what hour you think not,"_** says Jesus Christ, **_"the Son of Man will come,"_** (Luke xiii. 40.) An
unprovided death, which has happened to so many, may also happen to each of us. And it is
necessary to understand, that all who lead a bad life, meet with an unprovided death, though
their last illness may allow them some time to prepare for eternity; for the days of that mortal
illness are days of darkness days of confusion, in which it is difficult, and even morally
impossible, to adjust a conscience burdened with many sins. Tell me, brethren, if you were
now at the point of death, given over by physicians, and in the last agony, how ardently
would you desire another month, or another week, to settle the accounts you must render to
God! And God gives you this time. He calls you, and warns you of the danger of damnation
to which you are exposed. Give yourself, then, instantly to God. What do you wait for? Will
you wait till he sends you to hell?” **_Walk whilst you have light."_** (John xii. 35.) Avail
yourselves of this time and this light, which God gives you at this moment, and now, while it
is in your power, repent of all your past sins; for, a time shall come when you will be no
longer able to avert the punishment which they deserve.

Pentecost, on the practical death, or that which practically happens at the death of men of
the world. I know by experience that though it does notcontain Latin texts, whenever I
preached that sermon, it produced a great impression, and left the audience full of terror.
A greater impression is made by practical than by speculative truths.]**


**SERMON XXXIX. TENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - On the efficacy and
necessity of prayer.**
**_"God, be merciful to me a sinner." LUKE xviii. 13._**


IN this day’s gospel we read, that two men, one a Pharisee and the other a Publican, went to
the temple. Instead of bowing down to beg of God to assist him by his graces, the Pharisee
said **_: I thank thee, O Lord, that I am not as the rest of men, who are sinners. "Deus gratias
ago tibi, quia non sum sicut cæteri homines."_** But the Publican, tilled with sentiments of
humility, cried out: ” **_O God, be merciful to me, a sinner."_** St. Luke tells us, that this Publican
returned to his house justified; and that the Pharisee went home as guilty and as proud as
when he entered the temple. From this, most beloved brethren, you may infer how pleasing
to God, and how necessary for us, are our humble petitions to obtain from the Lord all the
graces which are indispensable for salvation. In this sermon I will show, in the first point, the
efficacy of prayer: and in the second, the necessity of prayer.


**_First Point. On the efficacy of prayer._**


1. To understand the efficacy and value of our prayers, we need only consider the great
promises which. God has made to every one who prays. **_"Call upon me, and I will deliver
thee."_** (Ps. xlix. 15.) **_Call upon me, and I will save you from every danger. ”He shall cry to me,
I will hear him."_** (Ps. xc. 15.) **_"Cry to me, and I will hear thee."_** (Jer. xxxiii. 3.) **_"You shall ask_**



**_whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you."_** (John xv. 7.) Ask whatsoever you wish
and it shall le given to you. There are a thousand similar passages in the Old and New
Testaments. **_By his nature God is,_** as St. Leo says, **_goodness itself. "Deus cujus natura
bonitas."_** Hence he desires, with a great desire, to make us partakers of his own good. St.
Mary Magdalene de Pazzi used to say, **_that when a soul prays to God for any grace, he feels
in a certain manner under an obligation to her, and thanks her; because by prayer the soul
opens to him a way of satisfying his desire to dispense his graces to us._** Hence, in the holy
Scriptures, the Lord appears to recommend and inculcate to us nothing more forcibly than to
ask and pray. To show this, the words which we read in the seventh chapter of St. Matthew
are sufficient. ” **_Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be
opened to you"_** (vii. 7). St. Augustine teaches, that **_by these promises God has bound himself
to grant all that we ask in prayer. ”By his promises he has made himself a debtor."_** (De Verb.
Dom. Serm. ii.) And, in the fifth sermon, the saint says, **_that if the Lord did not wish to
bestow his graces upon us, he would not exhort us so strenuously to ask them. "He would
not exhort us to ask, unless he wished to give."_** Hence we see that the Psalms of David and
the Books of Solomon and of the Prophets are full of prayers.


2. Theodoret has written, that prayer is so efficacious before God, that, ” **_though it be one, it
can do all things."“Oratio cum sit una, omnia potest."_** St. Bernard teaches, **_that when we
pray, the Lord, if he does not give the grace we ask, will grant a more useful gift. ”He will
give either what we ask, or what he knows to be more profitable to us."_** (Serm. v. in Fer. 4
cm.) And whom has God, when asked for aid, ever despised by not listening to his
petition? **_”Who hath called upon him, and he despised him ?"_** (Eccl. ii. 12.) The Scripture says,
that among the nations there is none that has gods so willing to hear our prayers, as our true
God. **_"Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh to them, as our God
is present to all our petitions."_** (Deut. iv. 7.) **_The princes of the earth,_** says St. Chrysostom,
**_give audience only to a few; but God grants it to every one that wishes for it. ”Aures
principis paucis patent, Die vero omnibus volentibus."_** (Lib. 2, de Orat.) David tells us that
this goodness of God in hearing us at whatever time we pray to him, shows us that he is our
true God, whose love for us surpasses the love of all others. ” **_In what day soever I shall call
upon thee, behold I know thou art my God."_** (Ps. lv. 10.) He wishes and ardently desires to
confer favours upon us; but he requires us to pray for them. Jesus Christ said one day to his
disciples: ” **_Hitherto you have not asked anything in my name; ask, and you shall receive,
that your joy may be full."_** (John xvi. 24.) As if he said: You complain of me for not making
you perfectly content; but you ought to complain of yourselves for not having asked of me all
the gifts you stood in need of; ask, henceforth, whatsoever you want, and your prayer shall
be heard. Many, says St. Bernard complain that the Lord is wanting to them. But he
complains with more justice **_that they are wanting to him, by neglecting to ask him for his
graces. ”Omnes nobis causamur deesse gratiam, sed justius forsitan ista sibi queritur deesse
nonnullos."_** (S. Bern, de Tripl. Cust.)



3. The ancient fathers, after having consulted to gether about the exercise most conducive to
salvation, came to the conclusion, that the best means of securing eternal life is, to pray
continually, saying: Lord, assist me; Lord, hasten to my assistance. ” **_Incline unto my aid,
God; Lord, make haste to help me."_** Hence the holy Church commands these two petitions to
be often repeated in the canonical hours by all the clergy and by all religious, who pray not
only for themselves, but also for the whole Christian world. St. John Climacus says, **_that our_**



**_prayers as it were compel God by a holy violence to hear us. "Prayer piously does violence to
God."_** Hence, when we pray to the Lord, He instantly answers by bestowing upon us the
grace we ask. ” **_At the voice of thy cry, as soon as he shall hear, he will answer thee."_** (Isa.
xxx. 19.) Hence St. Ambrose says, that” **_he who asks of God, receives while he asks."_** (Ep.
Ixxxiv., ad Demetr.) And he not only grants his grace instantly, but also abundantly, giving
us more than we pray for. St. Paul tells us that God is rich that is, liberal of his graces to every
one that prays to him. “ **_Rich unto all that call upon him."_** (Rom. x. 12.) And St. James says:
” **_If any of you want wisdom let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly and
upbraideth not. ”_** (St. James i. 5.)” **_He upbraideth not;"_** when we pray to him he does not
reproach us with the insults we have offered to him, but he appears then to forget all the
injuries we have done him, and to delight in enriching us with his graces.


**_Second Point On the necessity of prayer._**


4. ” **_God,"_** as St. Paul has written, ” **_will have all men to be saved, and to come to the
knowledge of the truth."_** (1 Tim. ii. 4.) According to St. Peter, he does not wish any one to be
lost. ” **_The Lord dealeth patiently for your sake, not willing that any soul should perish, but
that all should return to penance."_** (1 Pet. iii. 9 .) Hence St. Leo teaches, that **_as God wishes us
to observe his commands, so he prevents us by his assistance, that we may fulfil them. ”Juste
instat præcepto qui præcurrit auxilio."_** (Serm. xvi. de Pass.) And St. Thomas, in explaining
the words of the Apostle, ” **_God, who will have all men to be saved," says: “Therefore, grace
is wanting to no one; but he, on his part, communicates it to all."_** (In Epist, ad Hebr., cap.
xii., lect. 3.) And in another place the holy doctor writes: ” **_To provide every man with the
means necessary for his salvation, provided on his part he puts no obstacle to it, belongs to
Divine Providence."_** But, according to Gennadius, the assistance of his grace the Lord grants
only to those who pray for it. ” **_We believe... .that no one works out his salvation but by
God‟s assistance; and that he only who prays merits aid from God."_** (de Eccles. Dogm.) And
St. Augustine teaches, that, except the first graces of vocation to the faith and to repentance,
all other graces, and particularly the grace of perseverance, are granted to those only who ask
them. ” **_It is evident that God gives some graces, such as the beginning of faith, without
prayer and that he has prepared other graces, such as perseverance to the end only for those
who pray."_** (De dono persev., c.xvi.) And in another place he writes, that” **_God wishes to
bestow his favours; but he gives them only to those who ask."_** (In Ps. c.)



5. Hence theologians commonly teach, after St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, St. Augustine,
Clement of Alexandria, and others, that, for adults prayer is necessary as a means of
salvation; that is, that without prayer it is impossible for them to be saved. This doctrine may
be inferred from the following passages of Scripture: **_"We ought always to pray."_** (Luke xviii.
1.) **_"Ask, and you shall receive."_** (John xvi. 24.)” **_Pray without ceasing."_** (1 Thess. v. 17.) The
words **_we ought, ask, pray,_** according to St. Thomas (3 part, qu. xxxix. art. 5) **_and the
generality of theologians, imply a precept which obliges, under grievous sin, particularly in
three cases: First, when a man is in the state of sin; secondly, when he is in great danger of
falling into sin; and, thirdly, when he is in danger of death._** Theologians teach, **_that he who,
at other times, neglects prayer for a month, or at most for two months, cannot be excused
from mortal sin; because, without prayer we cannot procure the helps necessary for the
observance of the law of God._** St. Chrysostom teaches **_that as water is necessary to prevent_**



**_trees from withering, so prayer is necessary to save us from perdition. "Non ninus quam
arbores aquis, precibus indigemus."_** (Tom. l,hom. lxxvii.)



6. Most groundless was the assertion of Jansenius, that there are some commands, the
fulfilment of which is impossible to us, and that we have not even grace to render their
observance possible. For, the Council of Trent teaches, in the words of St. Augustine, that,
though man is not able, with the aid of the grace ordinarily given, to fulfil all the
commandments, still he can, by prayer, obtain the additional helps necessary for their
observance. ” **_God does not command impossibilities; but, by his precepts, he admonishes you
to do what you can, and to ask what you cannot do; and he assists you, that you may be
able to do it."_** (Sess. 6, cap. xi.) To this may be added another celebrated passage of St.
Augustine: ” **_By our faith, which teaches that God does not command impossibilities, we are
admonished what to do in things that are easy, and what to ask in things that are difficult."_**
(Lib. de Nat. et Grat., cap. lxix., n. 83.)


7. But why does God, who knows our weakness, permit us to be assailed by enemies which
we are not able to resist? The Lord, answers the holy doctor, **_seeing the great advantages
which we derive from the necessity of prayer, permits us to be attacked by enemies more
powerful than we are, that we may ask his assistance._** Hence they who are conquered cannot
excuse themselves by saying that they had not strength to resist the assault of the enemy; for
had they asked aid from God, he should have given it; and had they prayed, they should
have been victorious. Therefore, if they are defeated, God will punish them. St. Bonaventure
says, **_that if a general lose a fortress in consequence of not having sought timely succour from
his sovereign, he shall be branded as a traitor. ”Reputaretur infidelis, nisi expectaret a rege
auxilium."_** (S. Bon. Difet. tit, c. v.) Thus God regards as a traitor the Christian who, when he
finds himself assailed by temptations, neglects to seek the divine aid. ” **_Ask,"_** says Jesus
Christ, ” **_and you shall receive."_** Then, concludes St. Teresa, **_he that does not ask does not
receive._** This is conformable to the doctrine of St. James: ” **_You have not, because you do not
ask."_** (St. James iv. 2.) St. Chrysostom says, that prayer is a powerful weapon of defence
against all enemies. ” **_Truly prayer is a great armour."_** (Hom, xli., ad Pop.) St. Ephrem writes,
that he who fortifies himself beforehand by prayer, prevents the entrance of sin into the soul.
**_"If you pray before you work, the passage into the soul will not be open to sin."_** (Serm. de
Orat.) David said the same: **_"Praising I will call upon the Lord, and I shall be saved from my
enemies."_** (Ps. xvii. 4.)


8. If we wish to lead a good life, and to save our souls, we must learn to pray. ” **_He,"_** says St.
Augustine, ” **_knows how to live well who knows how to pray well."_** (Hom, xliii.) In order to
obtain God’s graces by prayer, it is necessary, first, to take away sin; for God does not hear
obstinate sinners. For example: if a person entertains hatred towards another, and wishes to
take revenge, God does not hear his prayer. ” **_When you multiply prayer, I will not hear; for
your hands are full of blood."_** (Isa. i. 15.) St. Chrysostom says, that **_he who prays while he
cherishes a sinful affection, does not pray, but mocks God. ”Qui orat et peccat, non rogat
Deum sed illudit."_** (Hom. xi., in Matt, vi.) But if he ask the Lord to take away hatred from his
heart, the Lord will hear him. Secondly, it is necessary to pray with attention. Some imagine
that they pray by repeating many Our Fathers, with such distraction that they do not know
what they say. These speak, but do not pray. Of them the Lord says, by the Prophet Isaias:
” **_With their lips they glorify me, but their hearts are far from me."_** (Isa. xxix. 13.) Thirdly, it is



necessary, as the Holy Ghost exhorts us, to take away the occasions which hinder us to pray.
” **_Let nothing hinder thee from praying always."_** (Eccl. xviii. 22.) He who is occupied in a
thousand affairs unprofitable to the soul, places a cloud before his prayers, which prevents
their passing to the throne of grace. ” **_Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may
not pass through."_** (Lamen. iii. 44.) I will not omit here the exhortation of St. Bernard, to ask
graces of God through the intercession of his divine mother. ” **_Let us ask grace, and ask it
through Mary; for she is a mother, and her prayer cannot be fruitless."_** (Serm. de Aqæd.) St.
Anselm says: **_"Many things are asked of God and are not obtained: what is asked of Mary is
obtained, not because she is more powerful, but because God decreed thus to honour her, that
men may know that she can obtain all things from God."_**


**SERMON XL. ELEVENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE VICE OF
SPEAKING IMMODESTLY.**
**_"He touched his tongue, .... and the string of his tongue was loosed." MARK vii. 33, 35._**


IN this day’s gospel St. Mark relates tlie miracle which our Saviour wrought in healing the
man that was dumb by barely touching his tongue. **_"He touched his tongue and the string of
his tongue was loosed."_** From. the last words we may infer that the man was not entirely
dumb, but that his tongue was not free, or that his articulation was not distinct. Hence St.
Mark tells us, that after the miracle he spoke right. Let us make the application to ourselves.
The dumb man stood in need of a miracle to loose his tongue, and to take away the
impediment under which he laboured. But how many are there on whom God would confer
a great grace, if he bound their tongues, that they might cease to speak immodestly! This vice
does great injury to others. Secondly, it does great injury to themselves. These shall be the
two points of this sermon.


**_First Point. The man who speaks immodestly does great injury to others who listen to him._**



1. In explaining the 140th Psalm, St. Augustine calls those who speak obscenely “ **_the
mediators of Satan,"_** the ministers of Lucifer; because, by their obscene language, the demon
of impurity gets access to souls, which by his own suggestions he could not enter. Of their
accursed tongues St. James says: **_"And the tongue is a fire,... being set on fire by hell."_** (James
iii. 6.) He says that the tongue is a fire kindled by hell, with which they who speak obscenely
burn themselves and others. The obscene tongue may be said to be the tongue of the third
person, of which Ecclesiasticus says: ”The tongue of a third person hath disquieted many,
and scattered them from nation to nation." (Eccl. xxviii. 16.) The spiritual tongue speaks of
God, the worldly tongue talks of worldly affairs; but tlie tongue of a third person is a tongue
of hell, which speaks of the impurities of the flesh; and this is the tongue that perverts many,
and brings them to perdition.


2. Speaking of the life of men on this earth, the Royal Prophet says: **_"Let their way become
dark and slippery."_** (Ps. xxxiv. 0.) In this life men walk in the midst of darkness and in a
slippery way. Hence they are in danger of falling at every step, unless they cautiously
examine the road on which they walk, and carefully avoid dangerous steps that is, the
occasions of sin. Now, if in treading this slippery way, frequent efforts were made to throw
them down, would it not be a miracle if they did not fall? **_"The Mediators of Satan,"_** who
speak obscenely, impel others to sin, who, as long as they live on this earth, walk in the midst



of darkness, and as long as they remain in the flesh, are in danger of falling into the vice of
impurity. Now, of those who indulge in obscene language, it has been well said: ” **_Their
throat is an open sepulchre."_** (Ps. v. 11.) The mouths of those who can utter nothing but filthy
obscenities are, according to St. Chrysostom, **_so many open sepulchres of putrified carcasses.
”Talia sunt ora hominum qui turpia proferunt."_** (Hom, ii., de Proph. Obs.) The exhalation
which arises from the rottenness of a multitude of dead bodies thrown together into a pit,
communicates infection and disease to all who feel the stench.


3. ” **_The stroke of a whip,"_** says Ecclesiasticus, **_"maketh a blue mark; but the stroke of a
tongue will break the bones."_** (Eccl. xxviii. 21.) The wounds of the lash are wounds of the
flesh, but the wounds of the obscene tongue are wounds which infect the bones of those who
listen to its language. St. Bernardino of Sienna relates, that a virgin who led a holy life, at
hearing an obscene word from a young man, fell into a bad thought, and afterwards
abandoned herself to the vice of impurity to such a degree that, the saint says, if the devil had
taken human flesh, he could not have committed so many sins of that kind as she committed.



4. The misfortune is, that the mouths of hell that frequently utter immodest words, regard
them, as trifles, and are careless about confessing them: and when rebuked for them they
answer: ” **_I say these words in jest, and without malice."_** In jest! Unhappy man, these jests
make the devil laugh, and shall make you weep for eternity in hell. In the first place, it is
useless to say that you utter such words without malice; for, when you use such expressions,
it is very difficult for you to abstain from acts against purity. According to St. Jerome, ” **_He
that delights in words is not far from the act. ”_** Besides, immodest words spoken before
persons of a different sex, are always accompanied with sinful complacency. And is not the
scandal you give to others criminal? Utter a single obscene word, and you shall bring into sin
all who listen to you. Such is the doctrine of St. Bernard. ” **_One speaks, and he utters only one
word; but he kills the souls of a multitude of hearers."_** (Serm. xxiv., in Cant.) A greater sin
than if, by one discharge of a blunderbuss, you murdered many persons; because you would
then only kill their bodies: but, by speaking obscenely, you have killed their souls.


5. In a word, obscene tongues are the ruin of the world. One of them does more mischief than
a hundred devils; because it is the cause of the perdition of many souls. This is not my
language; it is the language of the Holy Ghost. ” **_A slippery mouth worketh ruin."_** (Prov. xxvi.
28.) And when is it that this havoc of souls is effected, and that such grievous insults are
offered to God? It is in the summer, at the time when God bestows upon you the greatest
temporal blessings. It is then that he supplies you for the entire year with corn, wine, oil, and
other fruits of the earth. It is then that there are as many sins committed by obscene words, as
there are grains of corn or bunches of grapes. O ingratitude! How does God bear with us?
And who is the cause of these sins? They who speak immodestly are the cause of them.
Hence they must render an account to God, and shall be punished for all the sins committed
by those who hear them. **_"But I will require his blood at thy hand."_** (Ezec. iii. 11.) But let us
pass to the second point.


**_Second Point. He who speaks immodestly does great injury to himself._**


6. Some young men say: ” **_I speak without malice."_** In answer to this excuse, I have already
said, in the first point, that it is very difficult to use immodest language without taking



delight in it; and that speaking obscenely before young females, married or unmarried, is
always accompanied with a secret complacency in what is said. Besides, by using immodest
language, you expose yourself to the proximate danger of falling into unchaste actions: for,
according to St. Jerome, as we have already said, ” **_he who delights in words is not far from
the act."_** All men are inclined to evil. **_"The imagination and thought of man‟s heart are prone
to evil."_** (Gen. viii. 21.) But, above all, men are prone to the sin of impurity, to which nature
itself inclines them. Hence St. Augustine has said, that in struggling against that vice” **_the
victory is rare,"_** at least for those who do not use great caution. ” **_Communis pugna et rara
victoria."_** Now, the impure objects of which they speak are always presented to the mind of
those who freely utter obscene words. These objects excite pleasure, and bring them into
sinful desires and morose delectations, and afterwards into criminal acts. Behold the
consequence of the immodest words which young men say they speak without malice.



7. " **_Be not taken in thy tongue,"_** says the Holy Ghost. (Eccl. v. 1 6 .) Beware lest by your tongue
you forge a chain which will drag you to hell. ” **_The tongue,"_** says St. James, ” **_defileth the
whole body, and inflameth the wheel of our nativity."_** (St. James iii. 6.) The tongue is one of
the members of the body, but when it utters bad words it infects the whole body, and
**_"inflames the wheels of our nativity ;"_** it inflames and corrupts our entire life from our birth
to old age. Hence we see that men who indulge in obscenity, cannot, even in old age, abstain
from immodest language. In the life of St. Valerius, Surius relates that the saint, in travelling,
went one day into a house to warm himself. He heard the master of the house and a judge of
the district, though both were advanced in years, speaking on obscene subjects. The saint
reproved them severely; but they paid no attention to his rebuke. However, God punished
both of them: one became blind, and a sore broke out on the other, which produced deadly
spasms. Henry Gragerman relates (in Magn. Spec., dist. 9, ex. 58), that one of those obscene
talkers died suddenly and without repentance, and that he was afterwards seen in hell
tearing his tongue in pieces; and when it was restored he began again to lacerate it.


8. But how can God have mercy on him who has no pity on the souls of his
neighbours?” **_Judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy."_** (St. James ii. 13.)
Oh! what a pity to see one of those obscene wretches pouring out his filthy expressions
before girls and young married females! The greater the number of such persons present, the
more abominable is his language. It often happens that little boys and girls are present, and
he has no horror of scandalizing these innocent souls! Cantipratano relates that the son of a
certain nobleman in Burgundy was sent to be educated by the monks of Cluni. He was an
angel of purity; but the unhappy boy having one day entered into a carpenter’s shop, heard
some obscene words spoken by the carpenter’s wile, fell into sin, and lost the divine grace.
Father Sabitano, in his work entitled” **_Evangelical Light,"_** relates that another boy, fifteen
years old, having heard an immodest word, began to think of it the following night,
consented to a bad thought, and died suddenly the same night. His confessor having heard of
his death, intended to say Mass for him. But the soul of the unfortunate boy appeared to him,
and told the confessor not to celebrate Mass for him that, by means of the word he had heard,
he was damned and that the celebration of Mass would add to his pains. O God! how great,
were it in their power to weep, would be the wailing of the angel-guardians of these poor
children that are scandalized and brought to hell by the language of obscene tongues! With
what earnestness shall the angels demand vengeance from God against the author of such
scandals! That the angels shall cry for vengeance against them, appears from the words of



Jesus Christ **_: ”See that you despise not one of these little ones; for I say to you, that their
angels in heaven always see the face of my Father."_** (Matt, xviii. 10.)



9. Be attentive, then, my brethren, and guard your selves against speaking immodestly, more
than you would against death. Listen to the advice of the Holy Ghost: ” **_Make a balance for
thy words, and a just bridle for thy mouth; and take heed lest thou slip with thy tongue and
thy fall be incurable unto death."_** (Eccl. xxvhi. 29, 30.)” **_Make a balance"_** you must weigh
your words before you utter them and” **_a bridle for thy mouth"_** when immodest words come
to the tongue, you must suppress them; otherwise, by uttering them, you shall inflict on your
own soul, and on the souls of others, a mortal and incurable wound. God has given you the
tongue, not to offend him, but to praise and bless him. ” **_But, ”_** says St. Paul, **_“fornication and
all uncleanness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints."_** (Ephes. v.
3.) Mark the words” **_all uncleanness. ”_** We must not only abstain from obscene language and
from every word of double meaning spoken in jest, but also from every improper word
unbecoming a saint that is, a Christian. It is necessary to remark, that words of double
meaning sometimes do greater evil than open obscenity, because the art with which they are
spoken makes a deeper impression on, the mind.


1 0. **_Reflect,_** says St. Augustine, **_that your mouths are the mouths of Christians, which Jesus
Christ has so often entered in the holy communion. Hence, you ought to have a horror of
uttering all unchaste words, which are a diabolical poison. ”See, brethren, if it be just that,
from the mouths of Christians, which the body of Christ enters, an immodest song, like
diabolical poison, should proceed."_** (Serm. xv., de Temp.) St. Paul says, that the language of a
Christian should be always seasoned with salt. ” **_Let your speech be always in grace, seasoned
with salt. ”_** (Col. iv. 6.) Our conversation should be seasoned with words calculated to excite
others not to offend, but to love God. ” **_Happy the tongue,"_** says St. Bernard, ” **_that knows
only how to speak of holy things!"_** Happy the tongue that knows only how to speak of God!
brethren, be careful not only to abstain from all obscene language, but to avoid, as you would
a plague, those who speak immodestly. When you hear any one begin to utter obscene
words, follow the advice of the Holy Ghost: ” **_Hedge in thy ears with thorns: hear not a
wicked tongue."_** (Eccl. xxviii. 28.) **_"Hedge in thy ears with thorns"_** that is, reprove with zeal
the man who speaks obscenely; at least turn away your face, and show that you hate such
language. Let us not be ashamed to appear to be followers of Jesus Christ, unless we wish
Jesus Christ to be ashamed to bring us with him into Paradise.


**SERMON XLL TWELFTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE ABUSE OF DIVINE
MERCY.**
**_" Take care of him." LUKE x. 35._**


IN this day’s gospel we read, that a certain man fell into the hands of robbers, who, after
having taken his money, wounded him, and left him half dead. A Samaritan who passed by,
saw him, and taking pity on him, bound up his wounds, brought him to an inn, and left him
to the care of the host, saying: ” **_Take care of him."_** These words I this day address to those, if
there be any such among you, who, though their souls are wounded by sin, instead of
attending to the care of them, continually aggravate the wounds by new sins, and thus abuse
the mercy of God, who preserves their lives, that they may repent, and not be lost for ever. I
say to you: Brethren, take care of your souls, which are in a very bad state; have compassion



on them. ” **_Have pity on thy own soul."_** (Eccl. xxx. 24.) Your souls are sick, and what is worse
they are near the eternal death of hell; for he who abuses to excess the divine mercy, is on the
point of being abandoned by the mercy of God. This shall be the subject of the present
discourse.



1. St. Augustine says that the devil deludes Christians in two ways" by despair and hope."
After a person has committed sin, the enemy, by placing before his eyes the rigour of divine
justice, tempts him to despair of the mercy of God. But, before he sins, the devil by
representing to him the divine mercy, labours to make him fearless of the chastisement due
to sin. Hence the saint gives the following advice: ” **_After sin, hope for mercy; before sin, fear
justice."_** If, after sin, you despair of God’s pardon, you offend him by a new and more
grievous sin. Have recourse to his mercy, and he will pardon you. But, before sin, fear God’s
justice, and trust not to his mercy; for, they who abuse the mercy of God to offend him, do
not deserve to be treated with mercy. Abulensis says, that **_the man who offends justice may
have recourse to mercy; but to whom can they have recourse, who offend and provoke mercy
against themselves?_**


2. When you intend to commit sin, who, I ask, promises you mercy from God? Certainly God
does not promise it. It is the devil that promises it, that you may lose God and be damned.
” **_Beware,"_** says St. John Chrysostom, **_“never to attend to that dog that promises thee mercy
from God."_** (Hom. 50, ad Pop.) If, beloved sinners, you have hitherto offended God, hope and
tremble: if you desire to give up sin, and if you detest it, hope; because God promises pardon
to all who repent of the evil they have done. But if you intend to continue in your sinful
course, tremble lest God should wait no longer for you, but cast you into hell. Why does God
wait for sinners? Is it that they may continue to insult him? No; he waits for them that they
may renounce sin, and that thus he may have pity on them, and forgive them. **_"Therefore the
Lord waiteth, that he may have mercy on you."_** (Isa. xxx. 1, 8.) But when he sees that the time
which he gave them to weep over their past iniquities is spent in multiplying their sins, he
begins to inflict chastisement, and he cuts them off in the state of sin, that, by dying, they
may cease to offend him. Then he calls against them the very time he had given them for
repentance. **_"He hath called against me the time."_** (Lam. i. 15.) **_"The very time, ”_** says St.
Gregory, ” **_comes to judge."_**


3. O common illusion of so many damned Christians! We seldom find a sinner so abandoned
to despair as to say: I will damn myself. Christians sin, and endeavour to save their souls.
They say: ” **_God is merciful: I will commit this sin, and will afterwards confess it."_** Behold
the illusion, or rather the snare, by which Satan draws so many souls to hell. ”Commit sin,"
he says, ”and confess it afterwards." But listen to what the Lord says: **_"And say not, the mercy
of the Lord is great; he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins."_** (Eccl. v. 6.) Wy does he
tell you not to say, that the mercy of God is great? Attend to the words contained in the
following verse: **_"For mercy and wrath come quickly from him, and his wrath looketh upon
sinners."_** (Ibid., ver. 7.) The mercy of God is different from the acts of his mercy; the former is
infinite, the latter are finite. God is merciful, but he is also just. St. Basil says, **_that sinners
only consider God as merciful and ready to pardon, but not as just and prepared to inflict
punishment._** Of this the Lord complained one day to St. Bridget: **_"I am just and merciful:
sinners regard me only as merciful."_** St. Basil’s words are: **_“Bonus est Dominus sed etiam
Justus, nolimus Deum ex dimidia parte cogitare."_** God is just, and, being just, he must punish



the ungrateful. Father John Avila used to say, that to bear with those who avail themselves of
the mercy of God to offend him, would not be mercy, but a want of justice. Mercy, as the
divine mother said, is promised to those who fear, and not to those who insult the Lord.
**_“And his mercy to them that fear him."_** (Luke i. .50.)



4. Some rash sinners will say: God has hitherto shown me so many mercies; why should he
not here after treat me with the same mercy? I answer: he will show you mercy, if you wish
to change your life; but if you intend to continue to offend him, he tells you that he will take
vengeance on your sins by casting you into hell. **_"Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in
due time, that their foot may slide."_** (Deut. xxxii. 35.) David says, that” **_except you be
converted, ”_** he will **_"brandish his sword."_** (Ps. vii. 13.) The Lord has bent his bow, and waits
for your conversion; but if you resolve not to return to him, he will in the end cast the arrow
against you, and you shall be damned. O God! there are some who will not believe that there
is a hell until they fall into it. Can you, beloved Christians, complain of the mercies of God,
after he has shown you so many mercies by waiting for you so long? You ought to remain
always prostrate on the earth to thank him for his mercies, saying: ” **_The mercies of the Lord
that we are not consumed."_** (Lamen. iii. 32.) Were the injuries which you offered to God
committed against a brother, he would not have borne with you. God has had so much
patience with you; and he now calls you again. If, after all this, he shall send you to hell, will
he do you any wrong?” **_What is there,"_** he will say **_, ”that I ought to do more for my vineyard,
that I have not done to it ?"_** (Isa. v. 4.) Impious wretch! what more ought I to do for you that
I have not done?


5. St. Bernard says, that **_the confidence which sinners have in God‟s goodness when they
commit sin, procures for them, not a blessing, but a malediction from the Lord. ”Est infidelis
fiducia solius ubique maledictionis capax, cum videlicet in spe peccamus."_** (Serm, iii., de
Annunc.) O deceitful hope, which sends so many Christians to hell! St. Augustine says:
**_"Sperant, ut peccent! Væ a perversa spe."_** (In Ps. cxliv.) They do not hope for the pardon of
the sins of which they repent; but they hope that, though they continue to commit sin, God
will have mercy upon them; and thus they make the mercy of God serve as a motive for
continuing to offend him. accursed hope! hope which is an abomination to the Lord! **_“And
their hope the abomination. ”_** (Job xi. 20.) This hope will make God hasten the execution of
his vengeance; for surely a master will not defer the punishment of servants who offend him
because he is good. **_Sinners,_** as St. Augustine observes, **_trusting in God‟s goodness, insult
him, and say: "God is good; I will do what I please. ”_** (Tract, xxxiii. in Joan.) But, alas! how
many, exclaims the same St. Augustine, has this vain hope deluded!” **_They who have been
deceived by this shadow of vain hope cannot be numbered."_** St. Bernard writes, that Lucifer’s
chastisement was accelerated, because, in rebellion against God, he hoped that he should not
be punished lor his rebellion. Ammon, the son of king Manasses, seeing that God had
pardoned the sins of his
father, gave himself up to a wicked life with the hope of pardon; but, for Ammon there was
no mercy. St. John Chrysostom says, that Judas was lost because, **_trusting in the goodness of
Jesus Christ, he betrayed him. ”Fidit in lenitate Magistri."_**


6. He that sins with, the hope of pardon, saying: **_"I will afterwards repent, and God will
pardon me :"_** is, according to St. Augustine, ” **_not a penitent, but a scoffer."_** The Apostle tells
us that **_"God is not mocked."_** (Gal. vi. 7.) It would be a mockery of God to offend him as often



and as long as you please, and always to receive the pardon of your offences. ” **_For what
things a man shall sow,"_** says St. Paul, **_"those also shall he reap."_** (Ibid., ver. 8.) They who
sow sins, can hope for nothing but the hatred of God and hell. ” **_Despisest thou the riches of
his goodness, and patience, and long-suffering."_** (Rom. ii. 4.) Do you, O sinner, despise the
riches of the goodness, of the patience, and long-suffering of God towards you? He uses the
word riches, because the mercies which God shows us, in not punishing our sins, are riches
more valuable to us than all treasures. **_"Knowest thou not, ”_** continues the Apostle, **_"that the
benignity of God leadeth thee to penance ?"_** (Ibid.) Do you not know that the Lord waits for
you, and treats you with so much benignity, not that you may continue to sin, but that you
may weep over the offences you have offered to him? For, says St. Paul, if you persevere in
sin and do not repent, your obstinacy and impenitence shall accumulate a treasure of wrath
against the day of wrath, that is, the day on which God shall judge you. **_"According to thy
hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up wrath, against the day of wrath, and
revelation of the just judgment of God."_** (Ibid., verse 5.)



7. To the hardness of the sinner shall succeed his abandonment by God, who shall say of the
soul that is obstinate in sin, what he said of Babylon: ” **_We would have cured Babylon; but she
is not healed; let us forsake her."_** (Jer. li. 9.) And how does God abandon the sinner? He
either sends him a sudden death, and cuts him off in sin, or he deprives him of the graces
which would be necessary to bring him to true repentance; he leaves him with the sufficient
graces with which he can, but will not, save his soul. The darkness of his understanding, the
hardness of his heart, and the bad habits which he has contracted, will render his conversion
morally impossible. Thus, he shall not be absolutely but morally abandoned. ” **_I will take
away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted."_** (Isa. v. 5.) When the master of the vineyard
destroys its hedges, does he not show that he abandons it? It is thus that God acts when he
abandons a soul. He takes away the hedge of holy fear and remorse of conscience, and leaves
the soul in darkness, and then vices crowd into the heart. ” **_Thou hast appointed darkness,
and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the wood go about. ”_** (Ps. ciii. 20.) And the sinner,
abandoned in an abyss of sins, will despise admonitions, excommunications, divine grace,
chastisement, and hell: he will make a jest of his own damnation. ” **_The wicked man, when he
is come into the depth of sin, contemneth."_** (Prov. xviii. 3.)


8. ” **_Why,"_** asks the Prophet Jeremias, ” **_doth the way of the wicked prosper?"_** (Jer. xii. 1.) He
answers: ” **_Gather them together as sheep for a sacrifice."_** (v. 3.) Miserable the sinner who is
prosperous in this life! The prosperity of sinners is a sign that God wishes to give them a
temporal reward for some works which are morally good, but that he reserves them as
victims of his justice for hell, where, like the accursed cockle, they shall be cast to burn for all
eternity. **_"In the time of the harvest, I will say to the reapers: Gather up the first cockle, and
bind it in bundles to burn."_** (Matt. xiii. 30 .)


9. Thus, not to be punished in this life is the greatest of God’s chastisements on the wicked,
and has been threatened against the obstinate sinner by the Prophet Isaias. ” **_Let us have pity
on the wicked, but he will not learn justice."_** (Isa. xxvi. 10.) On this passage St. Bernard says:
**_This mercy I do not wish for: it is above all wrath. ”Misericordiam hanc nolo; super oimiem
iram misericordia ista."_** (Serin, xlii., in Cant.) And what greater chastisement than to be
abandoned into the Lands of sin, so that, being permitted by God to fall from sin to sin, the
sinner must in the end go to suffer as many hells as he has committed sins?” **_Add thou_**



**_iniquity upon their iniquity. .. .let them he "blotted out of the book of the living."_** (Ps. Ixviii.
28, 29.) On these words Bellarmine writes: ” **_There is no punishment greater than when sin is
the punishment of sin."_** It would be better for such a sinner to die after the first sin; because
by dying under the load of so many additional iniquities, he shall suffer as many hells as he
has committed sins. This is what happened to a certain comedian in Palermo, whose name
was Cæsar. He one day told a friend that Father La Nusa, a missionary, foretold him that
God should give him twelve years to live, and that if within that time he did not change his
life, he should die a bad death. **_Now, said he to his friend, I have travelled through so many
parts of the world: I have had many attacks of sickness, one of which nearly brought me to
the grave; but in this month the twelve years shall be completed, and I feel myself in better
health than in any of the past years._** He then invited his friend to listen to a new comedy
which he had composed. But, what happened? On the 24th November, 1688, the day fixed for
the comedy, as he was going on the stage, he was seized with apoplexy, and died suddenly.
He expired in the arms of a female comedian. Thus the scene of this world ended miserably
for him.



10. Let us make the application to ourselves, and conclude the discourse. Brethren, I entreat
you to give a glance at all the bygone years of your life: look at the grievous offences you
have committed against God, and at the great mercies which he has shown to you, the many
lights he has bestowed upon you, and the many times he has called you to a change of life.
By this sermon he has Today given you a new call. He appears to me to say to you: **_“What is
there that I ought to do to my vineyard, that I have not done to it ?"_** (Isa. v. 4.) What more
ought I to do for you that I have not done? What do you say? What answer have you to
make? Will you give yourselves to God, or will you continue to offend him? **_Consider,_** says
St. Augustine, **_that the punishment of your sins has been deferred, not remitted;_** ” **_unfruitful
tree! the axe has been deferred. Be not secure: you shall be cut off."_** If you abuse the divine
mercy, you shall be cut off; vengeance shall soon fall upon you. What do you wait for? Do
you wait till God sends you to hell? The Lord has been hitherto silent; but he is not silent for
ever. When the time of vengeance shall arrive he will say: ” **_These things hast thou done, and I
was silent. Thou thoughtest unjustly that I should be like to thee: but I will reprove thee, and
set before thy face. “_** (Ps. xlix. 21.) He will set before your eyes the graces which he bestowed
upon you, and which you have despised: these very graces shall judge and condemn you.
brethren, resist no longer the calls of God; tremble lest the call which he gives you Today
may be the last call for you. Go to confession as soon as possible, and make a firm resolution
to change your lives. It is useless to confess your sins, if you afterwards return to your former
vices. But you will perhaps say, that you have not strength to resist the temptations by which
you are assailed. Listen to the words of the Apostle: ” **_God is faithful, who will not permit
you to be tempted above that which you are able."_** (1 Cor. x. 13.) God is faithful: he will not
permit you to be tempted above your strength. And if of yourself you have not strength to
overcome the devil, ask it from God, and he will give it to you. ” **_Ask, and you shall receive."_**
(John xvi. 24.) **_"Praising," said David, ”I will call on the Lord, and I shall be saved from my
enemies."_** (Ps. xvii. 4.) And St. Paul said **_: ”I can do all things in him who strengthened me."_**
(Phil. iv. 13.) Of myself I can do nothing; but with the divine assistance I can do all things.
Recommend yourselves to God in all temptations, and God will enable you to resist them,
and you shall not fall.





### SERMON LXII THIRTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON AVOIDING BAD


### COMPANY.


**_"There met him ten men that were lepers... As they went, they were made clean." LUKE xvii.
12, 14._**


IN this day’s gospel it is related, that ten lepers of a certain town met Jesus Christ, and
entreated him to heal the leprosy under which they laboured. The Lord bid them go and
present themselves to the priests of the temple; but before they reached the temple they were
cured. Now it may be asked why our Saviour, who could heal them in an instant, wished
them to go to the priests, and healed them on the way. A certain author (Anthony of Lisbon)
says that Jesus Christ foresaw that, had he cured them on the spot, they, by remaining in the
place and conversing with the other lepers, from whom they took the leprosy, should easily
relapse into the same disease. Therefore, he first wished them to depart from the place and
then healed them. Whatever may be thought of this reason, let us come to the moral sense
which may be deduced from it. The leprosy resembles sin. As the leprosy is a contagious
disease, so the bad habits of the wicked infect others who associate with them. Hence, the
leper who wishes to be cured shall never be healed unless he separates from bad
companions. He that keeps company with robbers soon becomes a thief. In this discourse I
shall show, that, to lead a good life, it is necessary to avoid bad companions.



1. **_"A friend of fools,"_** says the Holy Ghost, **_"shall become like them."_** (Prov. xiii. 20.)
Christians who live in enmity with God are, Father M. Avila used to say, all fools, who
deserve to be shut up in a mad-house. For, what greater madness can be conceived than to
believe in hell and to live in sin? But the man who contracts an intimacy with these fools shall
soon be come like them. Although he should hear all the sermons of the sacred orators, lie
will continue in vice, according to the celebrated maxim: ” **_Examples make greater
impressions than words."_** Hence the Royal Prophet has said: ” **_With the elect thou wilt be
elect, and with the perverse thou wilt be perverted."_** (Ps. xvii. 27.) St. Augustine says, **_that
familiarity with sinners is as it were a hook which draws us to communicate in their vices.
Let us, said the saint, avoid wicked friends, ”lest by their company we may be drawn to a
communion of vice."_** St. Thomas teaches, **_that to know whom we should avoid is a great
means of saving our souls. Firma tutela salutis est, sciro quem fugiamus."_**


2. **_"Let their way become dark and slippery, and let the angel of the Lord pursue them."_** (Ps.
xxxiv. 6.) All men in this life walk in the midst of darkness and in a slippery way. If, then, a
bad angel that is, a wicked companion, who is worse than any devil pursue them, and
endeavour to drive them into an abyss, who shall be able to escape death?” **_Talis eris,"_** says
Plato, “ **_qualis conversatio quam sequeris ?"_** And St. John Chrysostom said, **_that if we wish to
know a man‟s moral habits, we have only to observe the character of the friends with whom
he associates; because friendship finds or makes him like his friends. ”Vis nosse hominem,
attende quorum familiaritate assuescat: amicitia aut pares invenit, aut pares fecit."_** First,
because, to please his friends, a man will endeavour to imitate them; secondly, because, as
Seneca says, nature inclines men to do what they see others do. And the Scripture says: *
They were mingled among the heathens, and learned their works." (Ps. cv. 35.) According to
St. Basil, **_as air which comes from pestilential places causes infection, so, by conversation
with bad companions, we almost imperceptibly contract their vices. ”Quemadmodum in
pestilentibus locis sensim attractus aër latentem corporibus morbuin iujicit sic itidem in_**



**_prava couversatione maxima a nobis mala hauriuntur, etiamsi statim incommodum non
sentiatur."_** (St. Bas., Hom, ix., ex var. quod Deus, etc.) And St. Bernard says **_that St. Peter, in
consequence of associating with the enemies of Jesus Christ, denied his Master. ”Existens
cum passionis dominicæ ministris, Doininum, negavit."_**



3. **_But how,_** asks St. Ambrose **_, can bad companions give you the odour of chastity, when they
exhale the stench of impurity?_** How can they infuse into you sentiments of devotion when
they themselves fly from it? **_How can they impart to you a shame of offending God, when
they cast it away?”Quid tibi demonstrant castitatem, quem non habent? Devotionem quam
non sequuntur? Verecundiam quam projiciunt?"_** St. Augustine writes of himself, **_that when he
associated with bad companions, who boasted of their wickedness, he felt himself impelled
to sin without shame; and to appear like them, he gloried in his evil actions. ”Pudebat," he
says, ”me esse pudentem."_** (Lib. 2, de Conf., c. ix.) Hence Isaias admonishes you to” **_touch no
unclean thing."_** (Isa. lii. 11.) Touch not what is unclean: if you do, you too shall be polluted.
He that handles pitch, says Ecclesiasticus, shall certainly be denied with it; and they who
keep company with the proud shall be clothed with pride. The same holds for other vices:
” **_He that toucheth pitch shall be denied with it; and he that hath fellowship with the proud
shall put on pride."_** (Eccl. xiii. 1.)


4. What then must we do? The Wise Man tells us that we ought not only to avoid the vices of
the wicked, but also to beware of treading in the ways in which they walk. ” **_Restrain thy foot
from their paths."_** (Prov. i. 15.) That is, we should avoid their conversations, their discourses,
their feasts, and all the allurements and presents with which they will seek to entice us into
their net. ” **_My son,"_** says Solomon, **_"if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them."_** (Prov. i.
10.) Without the decoy, birds are not enticed into the fowler’s net. ” **_Will the bird fall into the
snare upon the earth if there be no fowler?"_** (Amos iii. 5.) The devil employs vicious friends
as decoys, to draw so many souls into the snare of sin. **_"My enemies, ”_** says Jeremias, ” **_have
chased me, and have caught me like a bird without cause."_** (Lamen. iii. 52.) He says, without
cause. Ask the wicked why they have made a certain innocent young man fall into sin, and
they will answer: We have done it without cause; we only wish to see him do what we
ourselves do. **_This,_** says St. Ephrem, **_is one of the artifices of the devil: when he has caught a
soul in his net, he makes him a snare, or a decoy, to deceive others. ”Cum primum capta
fuerit, anima, ad alias decipiendas fit quasi laqueus."_**


5. Hence, it is necessary to avoid, as you would a plague, all familiarity with those scorpions
of hell. I have said that you must avoid familiarity with them that is, all fellowship in their
banquets or conversation; for never to meet them is, as the Apostle says, impossible.
” **_Otherwise you must needs go out of this world."_** (1 Cor. v. 10.) But, it is in our power to
abstain from familiar intercourse with them. ” **_But now I have written to you not to keep
company, etc. with such a one, not so much as to eat."_** (Ibid. v. 11.) I have called them
scorpions: so they have been called by the Prophet Ezechiel. ” **_Thou art among unbelievers
and destroyers, and thou dwellest among scorpions."_** (Ezec. ii. 6 ) Would you live in the
midst of scorpions? You must, then, fly from scandalous friends, who, by their bad examples
and words, poison your soul. ” **_A man‟s enemies shall be they of his own household."_** (Matt.
x. 36.) Wicked friends, that are very familiar and intimate with us, become the most
pernicious enemies of our souls. ” **_Who,"_** says Ecclesiasticus, ” **_will pity an enchanter struck
by a serpent, or any that come near wild beasts? So it is with him that keepeth company_**



**_with a wicked man."_** (Eccl. xii. 13.) If the man that makes free with serpents, or with ferocious
wild beasts, be bitten or devoured by them, who will take pity on him? And so it is with him
who associates with scandalous companions; if, by their bad example he be contaminated
and lost, neither God nor man will have compassion on him; because he was cautioned to fly
from their society.



6. One scandalous companion is enough to corrupt all who treat him as a friend. ” **_Know you
not,"_** says St. Paul, ” **_that a little leaven corrupts the whole lump ?"_** (1 Cor. v. 7.) One of these
scandalous sinners is able, by a perverse maxim, to infect all his companions. They are the
false prophets whom Jesus Christ warns us to avoid. "Beware of false prophets." (Matt. vii. 15
) False prophets deceive, not only by false predictions, but also by false maxims or doctrines,
which are productive of the greatest mischief. For, as Seneca says, **_they leave in the soul
certain seeds of iniquity which lead to evil. ”Semina in animo relinqueunt, quæ inducunt ad
malum. ”_** It is too true that scandalous language, as experience proves, corrupts the morals of
those who hear it. **_"Evil communications," says the Apostle, corrupt good manners. ”_** (1 Cor
xv 63.) A young man refuses, through the fear of God, to commit a certain sin: an incarnate
devil, a bad companion comes and says to him what the serpent said to Eve: “ **_No; you shall
not die the death."_** (Gen. iii. 4.) What are you afraid of? How many others commit this sin?
You are young; God will have pity on your youth. They will as is written in the book of
Wisdom, **_say Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that are present-let us everywhere
leave tokens of joy_** (ii 6 9) Come with us; let us spend our time in amusement and in joy. ” **_O
nimis imqua amicitia," says St. Augustine, cum dicitur, eamus, facimus: pudet non esse
impudentum O cruel friendship of those who say let us go and do etc.: it is a shame not to be
shameless._** He who hears such language is ashamed not to yield to it and not be as shameless
as they who utter it


7. When any passion is kindled within us, we must be particularly careful in selecting the
persons whom we will consult. For, then the passion itself will incline us to seek counsel
from those who will probably give the advice which is most agreeable to the passion. But
from such evil counsellors, who do not speak according to God, we should fly with greater
horror than from an enemy; for their evil counsel, along with the passion which is excited,
may precipitate us into horrible excesses. As soon as the passion shall subside we shall see
the error committed, and the delusion into which we have been led by false friends. But the
good advice of a friend, who speaks according to Christian truth and meekness preserves us
from every disorder, and restores calm to the soul.


8. ” **_Depart from the unjust,"_** says the Lord, **_and evils shall depart from thee."_** (Eccl. vii. 2.)
Fly, separate from wicked companions, and you shall cease to commit sin. ” **_Neither let the
way of evil men please thee. Flee from it: pass not by it: go aside and forsake it."_** (Prov. iv.
14, 15.) Avoid the ways in which these vicious friends walk, that you may not even meet
them. ” **_Forsake not an old friend; for the new will not be like to him."_** (Eccl. ix. 14.) Do not
leave your first friend, who loved you before you came into the world. ” **_I have loved thee
with an everlasting love."_** (Jer. xxxi. 3.) Your new friends do not love you; they hate you
more than your greatest enemy: they seek not your welfare, as God, does, but their own
pleasures, and the satisfaction of having companions of their wickedness and perdition. You
will, perhaps, say: I feel a repugnance to separate from such a friend, who has been solicitous
for my welfare; to break off from him would appear to be an act of ingratitude. What



welfare? What ingratitude? God alone wishes your welfare, because he desires your eternal
salvation. Your friend wishes your eternal ruin; he wishes you to follow him, but cares not if
you be damned. It is not ingratitude to abandon a friend who leads you to hell; but it is
ingratitude to forsake God, who has created you, who has died for you on the cross, and who
desires your salvation.



9. Fly then from the conversation of these wicked friends. ” **_Hedge in thy ears with thorns,
hear not a wicked tongue."_** (Eccl. xxviii. 28.) Beware of listening to the language of such
friends; their words may bring you to perdition. And when you hear them speak improperly
arm yourself with thorns, and reprove them, not only for the purpose of rebuking, but also of
converting them. ” **_Ut non solum,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_repellantur sed etiam compungantur."_**
Listen to a frightful example, and learn the evil which a wicked friend does. Father Sabatino
relates in his **_"Evangelical Light”_** that two friends of that kind were one day together. One of
them, to please the other, committed a sin; but after they had separated he died suddenly.
The other, who knew nothing of his death, saw, in his sleep, his friend, and, according to his
custom, ran to embrace him. But the deceased appeared to be surrounded with, fire, and
began to blaspheme the other, and to upbraid him for being the cause of his damnation. The
other awoke and changed his life. But his unhappy friend was damned; and for his
damnation there is not, and shall not be, any remedy for all eternity.


**SERMON XLIII. FOURTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ALL ENDS, AND
SOON ENDS.**
**_" The grass of the field, which is today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven." MATT. vii. 30._**


BEHOLD! all the goods of the earth are like the grass of the field, which Today is blooming
and beautiful, but in the evening it withers and loses its flowers, and the next day is cast into
the fire. This is what God commanded the Prophet Isaias to preach, when he said to him:
” **_Cry”_** And I said: **_What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower
of the field."_** (Isa. xl. 6.) Hence St. James compares the rich of this world to the flower of
grass: at the end of their journey through life they rot, along with all their riches and pomps.
” **_The rich... .because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away. For the sun rose with a
burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the
shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways."_** (St. James i. 10,
11.) They fade away and are cast into the fire, like the rich glutton, who made a splendid
appearance in this life, but afterwards” **_was buried in hell."_** (Luke xvi. 22.) Let us, then, dearly
beloved Christians, attend to the salvation of our souls, and to the acquisition of riches for
eternity, which never ends; for everything in this world ends, and ends very soon.


**_First Point. Everything ends._**


1. When one of the great of this world is in the full enjoyment of the riches and honours
which he has acquired, death shall come, and he shall he told: **_"Take order with thy house;
for thou shalt die, and not live."_** (Isa. xxxviii. 1.) Oh! what doleful tidings! The unhappy man
must then say: Farewell, world! farewell, O villa! farewell, grotto! farewell, relatives! farewell,
friends! farewell, sports! farewell, balls! farewell, comedies! farewell, banquets! farewell,
honours! all is over for me. There is no remedy: whether he will or not, he must leave all.
” **_For when he shall die, he shall take nothing away; nor shall his glory descend with him."_**



(Ps. xlviii. 18.) St. Bernard says, **_that death produces a horrible separation of the soul from the
body, and from all the things of this earth. ”Opus mortis horrendum divortium."_** (Serm.
xxvi., in Cant.)


To the great of this world, whom worldlings regard as the most fortunate of mortals, the bare
name of death is so full of bitterness, that they are unwilling even to hear it mentioned; for
their entire concern is to find peace in their earthly goods. ” **_O death!" says Ecclesiasticus,
”how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that hath peace in his possessions. ”_** (Eccl.
xli. 1.) But how much greater bitterness shall death itself cause when it actually comes
miserable the man who is attached to the goods of this world! Every separation produces
pain. Hence, when the soul shall be separated by the stroke of death from the goods on which
she had fixed all her affections, the pain must be excruciating. It was this that made king
Agag exclaim, when the news of approaching death was announced to him: **_"Doth bitter
death separate me in this manner?"_** (I Kings xv. 32.) The great misfortune of worldlings is,
that when they are on the point of being summoned to judgment, instead of endeavouring to
adjust the accounts of their souls, they direct all their attention to earthly things. But, says St.
John Chrysostom, **_the punishment which awaits sinners, on account of having forgotten God
during life, is that they forget themselves at the hour of death. ”Hac animadversione
percutitur impius, ut moriens obliviscatur sui, qui vivens oblitus est Dei."_**



2. But how great soever a man’s attachment to the things of this world may be, he must take
leave of them at death. Naked he has entered into this world, and naked he shall depart from
it. ” **_Naked," says Job, ”I came out of my mother‟s womb, and naked shall I return thither."_**
(Job i. 21.) In a word, they who have spent their whole life, have lost their sleep, their health,
and their soul, in accumulating riches and possessions shall take nothing with them at the
hour of death: their eyes shall then be opened; and of all they had so dearly acquired, they
shall find nothing in their hands. Hence, on that night of confusion, they shall be
overwhelmed in a tempest of pains and sadness. ” **_The rich man, when he shall sleep, shall
take away nothing with him! He shall open his eyes and find nothing... a tempest shall
oppress him in the night."_** (Job xxvii. 19, 20.) St. Antonine relates that Saladin, king of the
Saracens, gave orders at the hour of death, that the winding sheet in which he was to bo
buried should be carried before him to the grave, and that a person should cry out: ” **_Of all
his possessions, this only shall Saladin bring with him."_** The saint also relates that a certain
philosopher, speaking of Alexander the Great after his death, said: Behold the man that made
the earth tremble. ” **_The earth,"_** as the Scripture says **_, "was quiet before him."_** (1 Mach. i. 3.)
He is now under the earth. **_Behold the man whom the dominion of the whole world could not
satisfy: now four palms of ground are sufficient for him. ”Qui terram heri conculcubat, hodie
ab ea conculcatur; et cui heri non sufficiebat mundus hodie sufficiunt quatuor ulnæ terræ."_**
St. Augustine, or some other ancient writer, says, that having gone to see the tomb of Caesar,
he exclaimed: ” **_Princes feared thee; cities worshipped thee; all trembled before thee; where is
thy magnificence gone ?"_** (Serm. xxxviii. ad Fratr.) Listen to what David says: ” **_I have seen the
wicked highly exalted and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus. And I passed by, and lo! he
was not."_** (Ps. xxxvi. 35, 36.) Oh! how many such spectacles are seen every day in the world!
A sinner who had been born in lowliness and poverty, afterwards acquires wealth and
honours, so as to excite the envy of all. When he dies, every one says: He made a fortune in
the world; but now he is dead, and with death all is over for him.





3. ” **_Why is earth and ashes proud ?"_** (Eccl. x. 9.) Such the language which the Lord addresses
to the man who is puffed up by earthly honours and earthly riches. Miserable creature, he
says, whence comes such pride? If you enjoy honours and riches, remember that you are
dust. **_"For dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return."_** (Gen. iii. 19.) You must die, and
after death what advantage shall you derive from the honours and possessions which now
inflate you with pride? **_Go,_** says St. Ambrose, **_to a cemetery, in which are buried the rich and
poor, and see if you can discern among them who has been rich and who has been poor; all
are naked, and nothing remains of the richest among them but a few withered bones.
”Respice sepulchra, die mihi, quis ibi dives, quis pauper sit_** ” **_(_** lib. vi. exam., cap. viii). How
profitable would the remembrance of death be to the man who lives in the world!”He shall
be brought to the grave, and shall watch in the heap of the dead." (Job xxi. 32.) At the sight of
these dead bodies he would remember death, and that he shall one day be like them. Thus,
he should be awakened from the deadly sleep in which perhaps he lives in a state of
perdition. But the misfortune is, that worldlings are unwilling to think of death until the hour
comes when they must depart from this earth to go into eternity; and therefore they live as
attached to the world, as if they were never to be separated from it. But our life is short, and
shall soon end: thus all things must end, and must soon end.


**_Second Point. All soon ends._**



4. Men know well, and believe firmly, that they shall die; but they imagine death is far off as
if it were never to arrive. But Job tells us that the life of man is short. **_"Man born of a woman,
living for a short time, is filled with many miseries. Who cometh forth like a flower and is
destroyed."_** (Job xiv. 2.) At present the health of men is so much impaired, that, as we see by
experience, the greater number of them die before they attain the age of seventy. And what,
says St. James, is our life but a vapour, which a blast of wind, a fever, a stroke of apoplexy, a
puncture, an attack of the chest, causes to disappear, and which is seen no more?” **_For what is
your life? It is a vapour which appeareth for a little while."_** (St. James iv. 15.)”We all die,"
said the woman of Thecua to David, ”and like waters that return no more, we fall down into
the earth." (2 Kings xiv. 14.) She spoke the truth; as all rivers and streams run to the sea, and
as the gliding waters return no more, so our days pass away, and we approach to death.


5. They pass; they pass quickly. ” **_My days, ”_** says Job, **_"have been swifter than a post."_** (Job
ix. 25.) Death comes to meet us, and runs more swiftly than a post; so that every step we
make, every breath we draw, we approach to death. St. Jerome felt that even while he was
writing he was drawing nearer to death. Hence he said: ” **_What I write is taken away from
my life." "Quad scribo de mea vita tollitur."_** Let us, then, say with Job: Years passed by, and
with them pleasures, honours, pomps, and all things in this world pass away, ” **_and only the
grave remaineth for me."_** (Job xviii. 1.) In a word, all the glory of the labours we have
undergone in this world, in order to acquire a large income, a high character for valour, for
learning and genius, shall end in our being thrown into a pit to become the food of worms.
The miserable worldling then shall say at death: My house, my garden, my fashionable
furniture, my pictures and rich apparel, shall, in a short time, belong no more to me; **_”and
only the grave remaineth for me."_**


6. But how much soever the worldling may be distracted by his worldly affairs and by his
pleasures how much soever he may be entangled in them, St. Chrysostom says, **_that when_**



**_the fear of death, which sets fire to all things of the present life, begins to enter the soul, it
will compel him to think and to be solicitous about his lot after death. "Cum pulsare
animam incipit metus mortis (ignis instar præsentis vitæ omnia succendens) philosophari
eam cogit, et futura solicita mente versari." (Serm. in 2 Tim.)_** Alas! at the hour of death **_"the
eyes of the blind shall be opened."_** (Is xxxv. 5.) Then indeed shall he opened the eyes of those
blind worldlings who have employed their whole life in acquiring earthly goods, and have
paid but little attention to the interests of the soul. In all these shall be verified what Jesus
Christ has told them that death shall come when they least expect it. ” **_At what hour you
think not the Son of Man will come."_** (Luke xii. 40.) Thus, on these unhappy men death
comes unexpectedly. Hence, because the lovers of the world are not usually warned of their
approaching dissolution till it is very near, they must, in the last few days of life, adjust the
accounts of their soul for the fifty or sixty years which they lived on this earth. They will then
desire another month, or another week, to settle their accounts or to tranquillize their
conscience. But” **_they will seek for peace, and there shall he none."_** (Ezec. vii. 25.) The time
which they desire is refused. The assistant priest reads the divine command to depart
instantly from this world. ” **_Proficiscere, anima Christian! de hoc mundo. ”“Depart, Christian
soul, from this world."_** Oh! how dangerous the entrance of worldlings into eternity, dying, as
they do, amid so much darkness and confusion, in consequence of the disorderly state of the
accounts of their souls.


7. ” **_Weight and balance are the judgments of the Lord."_** (Prov. xvi. 11.) At the tribunal of God,
nobility, dignities, and riches have no weight; two things only our bins, and the graces
bestowed on us by God make the scales ascend or descend. They who shall be found faithful
in corresponding with the lights and calls which they have received, shall be rewarded; and
they who shall be found unfaithful, shall be condemned. We do not keep an account of God’s
graces; but the Lord keeps an account of them; he measures them; and when he sees them
despised to a certain degree, he leaves the soul in her sins, and takes her out of life in that
miserable state. ” **_For what things a man shall sow those also shall he reap."_** (Gal. vi. 8.)
From labours undertaken for the attainment of posts of honour and emolument, for the
acquisition of property and of worldly applause, we reap nothing at the hour of death: all are
then lost. We gather fruits of eternal life only from works performed, and tribulations
suffered for God.



8. Hence, St. Paul exhorts us to attend to our own business. **_"But we must entreat you,
brethren.... that you do your own business."_** (1 Thess. iv. 10, 11.) Of what business, I ask, does
the Apostle speak? Is it of acquiring riches, or a great name in the world? No; he speaks of the
business of the soul, of which Jesus Christ spoke, when he said: **_"Trade till I come."_** (Luke
xix. 13.) The business for which the Lord has placed, and for which he keeps us on this earth,
is to save our souls, and by good works to gain eternal life. This is the end for which we have
been created. ” **_And the end eternal life."_** (Rom. vi. 22.) The business of the soul is for us not
only the most important, but also the principal and only affair; for, if the soul be saved, all is
safe; but if the soul be lost, all is lost. Hence, we ought, as the Scripture says, to strive for the
salvation of our souls, and to combat to death for justice that is, for the observance of the
divine law. ” **_Strive for justice for thy soul, and even unto death fight for justice."_** (Eccl. iv.
33.) The business which our Saviour recommends to us, saying: **_Trade till I come,_** is, to have
always before our eyes the day on which he shall come to demand an account of our whole
life.



### 


9. All things in this world acquisitions, applause, grandeur must, as we have said, all end,
and end very soon. ” **_The fashion of this world passeth away."_** (1 Cor. vii. 31.) The scene of
this life passes away; happy they who, in this scene, act their part well, and save their souls,
preferring the eternal interests of the soul to all the temporal interests of the body. ” **_He that
hateth his life in this world, keepeth it unto life eternal."_** (John xii. 26.) Worldlings say:
Happy the man who hoards up money! happy they who acquire the esteem of the world, and
enjoy the pleasures of this life! folly! Happy he who loves God and saves his soul! The
salvation of his soul was the only favour which king David asked of God. ” **_One thing have I
asked of the Lord, this will I seek after."_** (Ps. xxvi. 4.) And St. Paul said, that to acquire the
grace of Jesus Christ which contains eternal life, he despised as dung all worldly goods. ” **_I
count all things as loss and I count them as dung, that I may gain Christ."_** (Phil, iii. 8.)


10. But certain fathers of families will say: I do not labour so much for myself as for my
children, whom I wish to leave in comfortable circumstances. But I answer: If you dissipate
the goods which you possess, and leave your children in poverty, you do wrong, and are
guilty of sin. But will you lose your soul in order to leave your children comfortable? If you
fall into hell, perhaps they will come and release you from it? O folly! Listen to what David
said: ” **_I have not seen the just man forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread."_** (Ps. xxxvi. 25.)
Attend to the service of God; act according to justice; the Lord will provide for the wants of
your children; and you shall save your souls, and shall lay up that eternal treasure of
happiness which can never be taken from you a treasure not like earthly possessions, of
which you may be deprived by robbers, and which you shall certainly lose at death. This is
the advice which the Lord gives you: ” **_But lay up to yourselves treasures in heaven, where
neither the rust nor the moth doth consume, and where thieves do not break through nor
steal."_** (Matt. vi. 20.) In conclusion, attend to the beautiful admonition which St. Gregory
gives **_to all who wish to live well and to gain eternal life. ”Sit nobis in intentione æternitas,
in usu temporalitas." Let the end of all our actions in this life be, the acquisition of eternal
goods; and let us use temporal things only to preserve life for the little time we have to
remain on this earth. The saint continues: ”Sicut nulla est proportio inter æternitatem et
nostræ vitæ tempus, ita nulla debet esse proportio inter æternitatis, et hujus, vitæ curas." As
there is an infinite distance between eternity and the time of our life, so there ought to be,
according to our mode of understanding, an infinite distance between the attention which we
should pay to the goods of eternity, which shall be enjoyed for ever, and the care we take of
the goods of this life, which death shall soon take away from us._**


**SERMON XLIV. FIFTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE PRACTICAL
DEATH, OR ON WHAT ORDINARILY HAPPENS AT THE DEATH OF MEN OF THE
WORLD.**
**_" Behold, a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother." LUKE vii. 12._**


IT is related in this day’s gospel that, going to the city of Naim, Jesus Christ met a dead man,
the only son of his mother, who was carried out to be buried. ” **_Behold, a dead man was
carried out."_** Before we proceed further, let us stop at these words and remember death. The
holy Church directs her ministers to say to Christians every year, on Ash Wednesday:
” **_Memento homo quia pulvis es, et in pulverum reverteris." Remember man, thou art but dust,
and into dust thou shalt return._** Oh! would to God that men had death always before their



eyes; if they had, they certainly should not lead such bad lives. Now, beloved brethren, that
the remembrance of death may be impressed upon you, I will this day place before your eyes
the practical death, or a description of what ordinarily happens at the death of men of the
world, and of all the circumstances attending it. Hence we shall consider, in the first point,
what happens at the time of the last illness: in the second point, what happens when the last
sacraments are received; and, in the third, what happens at the time of death.


**_First Point. What happens at the time of the last illness._**



1. I do not intend in this discourse to speak of a sinner who had always lived in habitual sin;
but of a worldling, who is careless about his salvation, and always entangled in the affairs of
the world, in contracts, enmities, courtships, and gaming. He has frequently fallen into
mortal sins, and after a considerable time has confessed them. In a word, he has been a
relapsing sinner, and has generally lived in enmity with God, or, at least, has been generally
perplexed with grievous doubts of conscience. Let us consider the death of such persons, and
what ordinarily happens at their death.


2. Let us commence at the time at which his last illness appears. He rises in the morning, he
goes out to look after his temporal affairs; but while he is engaged in business, he is assailed
by a violent pain in the head, his legs totter, he feels a cold shivering, which runs through
every member, a sickness of the stomach, and great debility over the whole body. He
immediately returns home and throws himself on the bed. His relatives, his wife and sisters,
run to him, and say: ” **_Why have you retired so early? Are you unwell ?"_** He answers: ” **_I feel
sick. I am scarcely able to stand; I have a great head-ache."“Perhaps” they say, ”you have
got a fever."“It must be so,"_** he replies, **_"send for a physician_**. ” The physician is immediately
sent for. In the meantime the sick man is put to bed, and there he is seized with a cold fit,
which makes him shiver from head to foot. He is loaded with covering, but the cold
continues for an hour or two, and is succeeded by a burning heat. The physician arrives, asks
the sick man how he feels; he examines the pulse, and find he has a severe attack of fever.
But, not to alarm him, the physician says: **_You have fever: but it is trifling. Have you given
any occasion to it?_** The sick man replies: **_I went out by night a few days ago, and caught
cold; or, I dined with a friend, and indulged my appetite to excess. It is worth nothing,_** the
physician says: **_it is a fulness of stomach, or more probably one of these attacks which occur
at the change of season. Eat nothing to-day: take a cup of tea; be not uneasy; be cheerful;
there is no danger. I will see you tomorrow._** Oh! that there was an angel, who, on the part of
God, would say to the physician: What do you say? Do you tell me that there is no danger in
this disease? Ah! the trumpet of the divine justice has, by the first symptoms of his illness,
given the signal of the death of this man: for him the time of God’s vengeance has already
arrived.


3. The night comes, and the poor invalid gets no rest. The difficulty of breathing and
headache increase. The night appears to him a thousand years. The light scarcely dawns
when he calls for some of the family. His relatives come, and say to him: Have you rested
well? **_Ah! I have not been able to close my eyes during the entire night. O God! how much do
I feel oppressed! Oh! how violent are the spasms in my head! I feel my temples pierced by
two nails. Send immediately for the physician; tell him to come as soon as possible._** The
physician comes, and finds the fever increased; but still he continues to say: ” **_Have courage;_**



**_there is no danger. The disease must take its course. The fever which accompanies it will
make it disappear."_** He comes the third day, and finds the sick man worse. He comes on the
fourth day, and symptoms of malignant fever appear. The taste on the mouth is disagreeable;
the tongue is black; every part of the body is restless; and delirium has commenced. The
physician, finding that the fever is acute, prescribes purging, bloodletting, and iced water. He
says to the relatives: **_Ah! the sickness is most severe; I do not wish to be alone. Let other
physicians be called in, that we may have a consultation._** This he says in secret to the
relatives, but not to the sick man on the contrary, not to frighten him, he continues to say: ” **_Be
cheerful; there is no danger."_**



4. Thus, they speak of remedies, of more physicians, and of a consultation; but not a word
about confession or the last sacraments. I know not how such physicians can be saved. Where
the Bull of Pope Pius the Fifth is in force, they expressly swear, when they receive the
diploma, that, after the third day of his illness, they will pay no more visits to any sick man
until he has made his confession. But some physicians do not observe this oath, and thus so
many poor souls are damned. For, when a sick man has lost his reason, of what use is
confession to him? He is lost. Brethren, when you fall sick, do not wait till the physician tells
you to send for a confessor; send for him of your own accord; for physicians, through fear of
displeasing a patient, do not warn him of his danger until they despair, or nearly despair of
his recovery. Thus, brethren, send first for your confessor call first for the physician of the
soul, and afterwards for the physician of the body. Your soul is at stake, eternity is at stake; if
you err then you have erred for ever; your mistake shall be for ever irreparable.


5. The physician, then, conceals from the sick man his danger; his relatives do what is still
worse they deceive him by lies. They tell him that he is better, and that the physicians give
strong hopes of his recovery. treacherous relatives! barbarous relatives, who are the worst of
enemies! Instead of warning the sick man of his danger (as is their duty, particularly if they
are parents, children, or brothers), that he may settle the accounts of his soul, they flatter him,
they deceive him, and cause him to die in the state of damnation. But, from the pains,
oppression, and restlessness which he feels, from the studied silence of friends who visit him,
and from the tears which he sees in the eyes of his relatives, the poor invalid perceives that
his disease is mortal. Alas! he says, the hour of death is come; but, through fear of giving me
annoyance, they do not warn me of it.


6. No; his relatives do not let him know that he is in danger of death; but because they attend
to their own interest, about which they are more solicitous than they are about anything else,
they bring in a scrivener, in the hope that the dying man will leave them a large portion of his
property. The scrivener arrives. **_Who is this?_** asks the sick man. The relatives answer: **_He is a
scrivener. Perhaps, for your own satisfaction, you would like to make your will. Then is my
sickness mortal? Am I near my end? No, father, or brother, they say: we know that there is
no necessity for making a will; but you must one day make it, and it would be better to do it
now, while you have the full use of all your faculties. Very well,_** he replies; **_since the
scrivener is come, and since you wish me to do it, I will make my last will._** The scrivener first
asks the sick man in what church he wishes to be buried, in case he should die. Oh! what a
painful question! After choosing the place of his interment, he begins to dispose of all his
goods. **_I bequeath such an estate or farm to my children; such a house to my brother; such a
sum of money to a friend; and such an article of furniture to an acquaintance._** O miserable



man, what have you done? You have submitted to so much fatigue, you have burthened your
conscience with so many sins, in order to acquire these goods; and now you leave them for
ever, and bequeath them to such and such persons. But there is no remedy; when death
comes we must leave all things. This separation from all worldly possessions is very painful
to the sick man, whose heart was attached to his property, his house, his garden, his money,
and his amusements. Death comes, gives the stroke, and separates the heart from all the
objects of its love. This stroke tortures the sick man with excruciating pain. Ah, brethren! let
us detach our hearts from the things of this world before death separates us from them with
so much pain, and with such great danger to our salvation.


**_Second Point. "What happens at the time in which the sacraments are received._**



7. Behold! the dying man has made his will. After the eighth or tenth day of his illness, seeing
that he is daily growing worse, and that he is near his end, one of his relatives asks: ” **_When
shall we send for his confessor? He has been a man of the world. We know that he has not
been a saint."_** They all agree that the confessor should be sent for; but all refuse to speak to
the sick an on the subject. Hence they send for the parish priest, or for some other confessor,
to make known to the dying man his danger, and the necessity of receiving the last
sacraments. But this is done only when he has nearly lost the use of his faculties. The
confessor comes; he inquires from the family about the state of the sick man, and the sort of
life which he led. He finds that he has been careless about the duties of religion, and, from the
circumstances which he hears, he trembles for the salvation of the poor soul. Understanding
that the dying man has but a short time to live, the confessor, first of all, orders the relatives
to leave the room, and to return to it no more. He then approaches and salutes the sick man.
The latter asks: "Who are you? I am, replies the confessor, the parish priest, Father Such-a-
one. Do you wish me to do anything for you? Having heard that you had a severe attack of
illness, I have come to reconcile you with your Creator. Father, I am obliged to you; but I beg
of you for the present to let me take a little rest; for I have got no sleep for several nights, and
I am scarcely able to speak. Recommend me to God.


8. Knowing the dangerous state of the soul and body of the sick man, the confessor says: We
hope that the Lord and the most holy Virgin will deliver you from this illness; but, sooner or
later, you must die. Your illness is very severe. You would do well to make your confession,
and to adjust the affairs of your soul. Perhaps you have scruples of conscience. I have come
on purpose to calm the troubles of your mind. Father, I should have to make a long
confession; for my conscience is perplexed and burdened with sin. At present I am not able to
do it. I feel a lightness in my head, and I can scarcely breathe. Father, we will see about it to-
morrow, at present I am not able. But who knows what may happen? Some attack may come
on, which will not leave you time to make your confession. Father, do not torment me any
longer. I have said that I am not able; it is impossible for me to do it.


But the confessor, who knows that there is no hope of recovery, feels himself obliged to speak
more plainly, and says: I think it is my duty to inform you that your life is about to close. I
entreat you to make your confession: for, perhaps, tomorrow you shall be dead. Why, father,
do you say so? Because, replies the confessor, so the physicians have said. The poor dying
man then begins to rage against the physicians, and against his friends. Ah! the traitors have
deceived me. They knew my danger, and have not informed me of it. Ah! unhappy me! The



confessor rejoins, and says: Be not alarmed at the difficulties of making your confession: it is
enough to mention the most grievous sins which you remember. I will assist you. Be not
afraid. Begin at once to tell your sins. The dying man forces himself to commence his
confession; but his mind is all confusion; he knows not where to begin; he tries to tell his sins,
but is not able to explain himself. He feels but little, and understands still less, what the
confessor says to him. O God! At such a time, and in such a state, worldlings are obliged to
attend to the most important of all affairs the affair of eternal salvation! The confessor hears,
perhaps, many sins, bad habits, injuries done to the property and character of others,
confessions made with little sorrow and with little purpose of amendment. He assists the
dying man as well as he can, and, after a short exhortation, tells him to make an act of
contrition. But, God grant that he may not be as insensible to sorrow as the sick man who
was attended by Cardinal Bellarmine. When the Cardinal exhorted him to make an act of
contrition, he said: Father, do not trouble yourself; these things are too high for me; I do not
understand them. In the end, the confessor absolves the dying man; but who knows if God
absolves him?



9. After giving him absolution, the confessor says: Prepare yourself, now, to receive Jesus
Christ for your viaticum. It is now, replies the sick man, four or five hours after night; I will
communicate in the morning. No: perhaps in the morning time shall be no more for you; you
must at present receive the viaticum and extreme unction. Ah, unhappy me! the dying man
says; am I then at the point of death? He has reason to say so; for the practice of some
physicians is, to put off the viaticum till the patient is near his last, and till he has lost, or
nearly lost, his senses. This is a common delusion. According to the common opinion of
theologians, the viaticum ought always to be administered when there is danger of death. It
would be useful here to observe, that Benedict the Fourteenth, in his fifty- third Bull (in
Euchol. Grace.,. 46, ap. Bullar, tom. 4), says, that **_extreme unction may be given whenever the
sick man”labours under a grievous illness."_** Hence, whenever the sick can receive the
viaticum, they can also receive the sacrament of extreme unction. It is not necessary to wait,
as some physicians recommend, till they are near the agony, or till they lose their senses.


10. Behold! the viaticum arrives, the sick man hears the bell. Oh! how he trembles! The
trembling and terror increase when he sees the priest coming into the room with the holy
sacrament, and when he beholds around his bed the torches of those who assisted at the
procession. The priest recites the words of the ritual: **_"Accipe frater viaticum corporis Domini
nostri Jesu Christi qui te custodiat ab hoste maligno, et perducat in vitam æternum. Amen."
Brother, receive the viaticum of the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he may preserve you
from the wicked enemy, and that he may bring you to eternal life._** He receives the
consecrated host upon his tongue: the priest then gives him a little water to enable him to
swallow it; for his throat is dry and parched.


11. The priest afterwards gives the extreme unction; and begins by anointing the eyes while
he says the following words: **_"Per istam sanctam unctionem, et suam piissimam
misericordiam, indulgeat tibi Deus, quidquid per visum deliquisti."_** He then anoints the other
senses the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the hands, the feet, and the loins, saying: ” **_Quidquid
per aditum deliquisti per odoratum, per gustum et locutionem, per tactum, per gressum, et
lumborum delectationem."_** And, during the administration of the extreme unction, the devil
is employed in reminding the sick man of all the sins he committed by the senses by the eyes,



the ears, the tongue, the hands; and says to him: After so many sins can you expect to be
saved? Oh! what terror is then caused by every one of those mortal sins, which are now
called human frailties, and which, worldlings say, God will not punish! Now they are
disregarded; but then every mortal sin shall be a sword that will pierce the soul with terror.
But let us come to what happens at death.


**_Third Point. What happens at the time of death._**



12. After having administered the sacraments the priest departs, and leaves the dying man
alone. He feels more terror and alarm after the sacraments than before he received them; for
he knows that his entire preparation for them was made in the midst of great confusion of
mind and great uneasiness of conscience. But the signs of approaching death appear: the sick
man falls into a cold sweat; the sight grows dim, and he no longer knows the persons that
attend him: he has lost his speech, and can scarcely breathe. In the midst of this darkness of
death he continues to say: ” **_Oh! that I had time, that I had another day, with the use of my
faculties, to make a good confession!"_** For, the unhappy man has great doubts about the
confession which he has made: he feels that he was not able to excite himself to make a true
act of sorrow. But, what time? what day? **_"Time shall be no longer."_** (Apoc. x. 6.) The
confessor has the book open to announce to him his departure from this world. **_"Profiscere,
anima Christiana, de hoc mundo." Depart, Christian soul, from this world._** The dying man
continues to say within himself: **_"O lost years of my life! fool that I have been!"_** But when
does he say this? When the scene is about to close for him; when the oil in the lamp is just
consumed; and when the great moment has arrived on which his eternal happiness or misery
depends.


13. But behold! his eyes are petrified; his body takes the posture of a corpse; the extremities,
the hands and feet, have become cold. The agony commences; the priest begins to recite the
prayers for the recommendation of a departing soul. After having read the recommendation,
he feels the pulse of the dying man, and feels that it has ceased to beat. Light, he says,
immediately the blessed candle. O candle! O candle! show us light, now that we have health;
for, at the hour of death, thy light shall serve only to terrify us the more. But already the
breathing of the sick man is not so frequent; it has begun to fail This is a sign that death is
very near. The assisting priest raises his voice, and says to the poor man in his agony: **_Say
after me O God, come to my aid; have mercy on me. My crucified Jesus, save me through thy
passion. Mother of God, intercede for me. St. Joseph, St. Michael, the archangel, my holy
angel-guardian, and all ye saints in Paradise, pray to God for me. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus and
Mary, I give you my heart and my soul._** But behold the last signs of death; the phlegm is
confined in the throat; the dying man sends forth feeble moans; the tears rush from his eyes;
finally he twists the mouth, he distorts the eyes, he makes a few pauses, and at the last
opening of the mouth, he expires and dies.


14. The priest then brings a candle to the mouth of the dead man, to try if he be still alive: he
sees that the flame is not moved, and thence infers that life is extinct. He says: **_Requiescat in
pace. May he rest in peace._** And turning to the bystanders, announces that he is dead. ” **_I
hope,"_** he adds, ” **_he is gone to heaven."_** He is dead, and how has he died? No one knows
whether he is saved or damned; but he has died in a great tempest. Such is the death of those
unfortunate men who, during life, have cared little about God. ” **_Their souls shall die in a_**



**_storm."_** (Job xxxvi. 14.) Of every one that dies it is usual to say that” **_he is gone to heaven."_** He
is gone to heaven if he deserved heaven; but, if he merited hell, he has gone to hell. Do all go
to heaven? Oh! how few enter into that abode of bliss!



15. Before the body is cold he is covered with a worn out garment; because it must soon rot
with him in the grave. Two lighted candles are placed in the chamber; the curtain of the bed
on which the dead man lies is let down, and he is left alone. The parish priest is sent for, and
requested to come in the morning and take away the corpse. The priest comes; the deceased
is carried to the church; and this is his last journey on this earth. The priests begin to sing
the” **_De profundis clamavi ad te Domine," etc._** The spectators, who look at the funeral as it
passes, speak of the deceased. One says: ”He was a proud man." Another: ”Oh! that he had
died ten years ago!" A third: ”He was fortu nate in the world; he made a great deal of money!
he had a fine house, but now he takes nothing with him. ” And while they speak of him in
this manner he is burning in hell. He arrives at the church, and is placed in the middle,
surrounded by six candles. Tho bystanders look at him, but suddenly turn away their eyes,
because his appearance excites horror. The Mass is sung for his repose, and after Mass,
the”Libera ;" and the function is concluded with these words: Requiescat in pace May he rest
in peace. May he rest in peace, if he died in peace with God; but, if he has died in enmity with
God, what peace what peace can he enjoy? He shall have no peace as long as God shall be
God. The sepulchre is then opened, the corpse is thrown into it; the grave is covered with a
tombstone; and he is left there to rot and to be the food of worms. It is thus that the scene of
this world ends for each of us. His relatives put on mourning; but they first divide among
themselves the property which he has left. They shed an occasional tear for two or three days,
and afterwards forget him. And what shall become of him? If he be saved, he shall be happy
for ever; if damned, he must be miserable for eternity.


**SERMON XLV. SIXTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON IMPURITY.**
“And behold, there was a certain man before him, who had the dropsy." LUKE xiv. 2.


THE man who indulges in impurity is like a person labouring under the dropsy. The latter is
so much tormented by thirst, that the more he drinks the more thirsty he becomes. Such, too,
is the nature of the accursed vice of impurity; it is never satiated. **_"As,"_** says St. Thomas of
Villanova **_, ”the more the dropsical man abounds in moisture, the more he thirsts; so, too, is
it with the waves of eternal pleasures."_** I will speak Today of the vice of impurity, and will
show, in the first point, the delusion of those who say that this vice is but a small evil; and, in
the second, the delusion of those who say, that God takes pity on this sin, and that he does
not punish it.


**_First Point. Delusion of those who say that sins against purity are not a great evil._**


1. The unchaste, then, say that sins contrary to purity are but a small evil. Like” **_the sow
wallowing in the mire" (" Sus lota in volutabro luti - 2 Pet. ii. 22)_** , they are immersed in their
own filth, so that they do not see the malice of their actions; and therefore they neither feel
nor abhor the stench of their impurities, which excite disgust and horror in all others. Can
you, who say that the vice of impurity is but a small evil can you, I ask, deny that it is a
mortal sin? If you deny it, you are a heretic; for as St. Paul says: **_"Do not err. Neither
fornicators, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, etc., shall possess the kingdom of God."_** (1



Cor. vi. 9.) It is a mortal sin; it cannot be a small evil. It is more sinful than theft, or detraction,
or the violation of the fast. How then can you say that it is not a great evil? Perhaps mortal
sin appears to you to be a small evil? Is it a small evil to despise the grace of God, to turn
your back upon him, and to lose his friendship, for a transitory, beastly pleasure?



2. St. Thomas teaches, that mortal sin, because it is an insult offered to an infinite God,
contains a certain infinitude of malice. **_"A sin committed against God has a certain
infinitude, on account of the infinitude of the Divine Majesty."_** (S. Thom., 3 p., q. 1, art. 2, ad.
2.) Is mortal sin a small evil? It is so great an evil, that if all the angels and all the saints, the
apostles, martyrs, and even the Mother of God, offered all their merits to atone for a single
mortal sin, the oblation would not be sufficient. No; for that atonement or satisfaction would
be finite; but the debt contracted by mortal sin is infinite, on account of the infinite Majesty of
God which has been offended. The hatred which God bears to sins against purity is great
beyond measure. If a lady find her plate soiled she is disgusted, and cannot eat. Now, with
what disgust and indignation must God, who is Purity itself, behold the filthy impurities by
which his law is violated? He loves purity with an infinite love; and consequently he has an
infinite hatred for the sensuality which the lewd, voluptuous man calls a small evil. Even the
devils who held a high rank in heaven before their fall disdain to tempt men to sins of the
flesh.


3. St. Thomas says (lib. 5, de Erud. Princ., c. li.), **_that Lucifer, who is supposed to have been
the devil that tempted Jesus Christ in the desert, tempted him to commit other sins, but
scorned to tempt him to offend against chastity._** Is this sin a small evil? Is it, then, a small evil
to see a man endowed with a rational soul, and enriched with so many divine graces, bring
himself by the sin of impurity to the level of a brute? **_”Fornication and pleasure,"_** says St.
Jerome, ” **_pervert the understanding, and change men into beasts."_** (In Oseam., c. iv.) In the
voluptuous and unchaste are literally verified the words of David: ”And man, when he was
in honour, did not understand: he is compared to senseless beasts, and is become like to
them." (Ps. xlviii. 13.) St. Jerome says, that **_there is nothing more vile or degrading than to
allow oneself to be conquered by the flesh. ”Nihil vilius quam vinci a carne."_** Is it a small evil
to forget God, and to banish him from the soul, for the sake of giving the body a vile
satisfaction, of which, when it is over, you feel ashamed? Of this the Lord complains by the
Prophet Ezechiel: ”Thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast forgotten me, and has cast me
off behind thy back”(xxiii. 35.) St. Thomas says, that **_by every vice, but particularly by the
vice of impurity, men are removed far from God. ”Per luxuriant maxime recedit a Deo." (_** In
Job cap. xxxi.)


4. Moreover, sins of impurity, on account of their great number, are an immense evil. A
blasphemer does not always blaspheme, but only when he is drunk or provoked to anger.
The assassin, whose trade is to murder others, does not, at the most, commit more than eight
or ten homicides. But the unchaste are guilty of an unceasing torrent of sins, by thoughts, by
words, by looks, by complacencies, and by touches; so that, when they go to confession they
find it impossible to tell the number of the sins they have committed against purity. Even in
their sleep the devil represents to them obscene objects, that, on awakening, they may take
delight in them; and because they are made the slaves of the enemy, they obey and consent to
his suggestions; for it is easy to contract a habit of this sin. To other sins, such as blasphemy,
detraction, and murder, men are not prone; but to this vice nature inclines them. Hence St.



Thomas says, **_that there is no sinner so ready to offend God as the votary of lust is, on every
occasion that occurs to him. ”Nullus ad Dei contemptum promptior."_** The sin of impurity
brings in its train the sins of defamation, of theft, hatred, and of boasting of its own filthy
abominations. Besides, it ordinarily involves the malice of scandal. Other sins, such as
blasphemy, perjury, and murder, excite horror in those who witness them; but this sin excites
and draws others, who are flesh, to commit it, or, at least, to commit it with less horror.


5. ” **_Totum hominem,"_** says St. Cyprian, ” **_agit in triumphum libidinis."_** (Lib. de bono pudic.)
By lust the evil triumphs over the entire man, over his body and over his soul; over his
memory, filling it with the remembrance of unchaste delights, in order to make him take
complacency in them; over his intellect, to make him desire occasions of committing sin; over
the will, by making it love its impurities as his last end, and as if there were no God. **_"I
made,"_** said Job, **_“a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.
For what part should God from above have in me?"_** (xxxi. 1, 2.) Job was afraid to look at a
virgin, because he knew that if he consented to a bad thought God should have no part in
him. According to St. Gregory, **_from impurity arises blindness of understanding, destruction,
hatred of God, and despair of eternal life. ”De luxuria cœcitas mentis præcipitatio, odium
Dei, desperatio futuri sæculi generantur."_** (S. Greg., Mor., lib. 13.) St. Augustine says, **_though
the unchaste may grow old, the vice of impurity does not grow old in them._** Hence St.
Thomas says, **_that there is no sin in which the devil delights so much as in this sin; because
there is no other sin to which nature clings with so much tenacity. To the vice of impurity it
adheres so firmly, that the appetite for carnal pleasures becomes insatiable. ”Diabolus
dicitur gaudere maxime de peccato luxuriæ, quia est maximæ adhœrentia: et difficile ab eo
homo eripi potest; insatiabilis est enim delectabilis appetitus."_** (1, 2 , qu. 73, a. 5, ad. 2.) Go
now, and say that the sin of impurity is but a small evil. At the hour of death you shall not
say so; every sin of that kind shall then appear to you a monster of hell. Much less shall you
say so before the judgment-seat of Jesus Christ, who will tell you what the Apostle has
already told you: **_"No fornicator, or unclean, hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and
God."_** (Eph. v. 5.) The man who has lived like a brnte does not deserve to sit with the angels.



6. Most beloved brethren, let us continue to pray to God to deliver us from this vice: if we do
not, we shall lose our souls. The sin of impurity brings with it blindness and obstinacy. Every
vice produces darkness of understanding; but impurity produces it in a greater degree than
all other sins. ” **_Fornication, and wine, and drunkenness take away the understanding."_** (Osee
iv. 11.) Wine deprives us of understanding and reason; so does impurity. Hence St. Thomas
says, **_that the man who indulges in unchaste pleasures, does not live according to reason. ”In
nullo procedit secundum judicium rationis."_** Now, if the unchaste are deprived of light, and
no longer see the evil which they do, how can they abhor it and amend their lives? The
Prophet Osee says, that being blinded by their own mire, they do not even think of returning
to God; because their impurities take away from them all knowledge of God. ” **_They will not
set their thought to return to their God; for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them,
and they have not known the Lord."_** (Osee v. 4.) Hence St. Lawrence Justinian writes, **_that
this sin makes men forget God. ”Delights of the flesh induced forgetfulness of God."_** And St.
John Damascene teaches that” **_the carnal man cannot look at the light of truth."_** Thus, the
lewd and voluptuous no longer understand what is meant by the grace of God, by judgment,
hell, and eternity. ” **_Fire hath fallen upon them, and they shall not see the sun."_** (Ps. Ivii. 9.)



Some of these blind miscreants go so far as to say, that fornication is not in itself sinful. They
say, that it was not forbidden in the Old Law; and in support of this execrable doctrine they
adduce the words of the Lord to Osee: ” **_Go, take thee a wife of fornication, and have of her
children of fornication."_** (Osee i. 2.) In answer I say, that God did not permit Osee to commit
fornication; but wished him to take for his wife a woman who had been guilty of fornication:
and the children of this marriage were called children of fornication, because the mother had
been guilty of that crime. This is, according to St. Jerome, the meaning of the words of the
Lord to Osee. ” **_Ideirco,"_** says the holy doctor, ” **_Fornicationis appelandi sunt filii, quod sunt
de meretrice generati."_** But fornication was always forbidden, under pain of mortal sin, in the
Old, as well as in the New Law. St. Paul says: ” **_No fornicator or unclean, hath inheritance in
the kingdom of Christ and of God."_** (Eph. v. 5.) Behold the impiety to which the blindness of
such sinners carry them! From this blindness it arises, that though they go to the sacraments,
their confessions are null for want of true contrition; for how is it possible for them to have
true sorrow, when they neither know nor abhor their sins?



7. The vice of impurity also brings with it obstinacy. To conquer temptations, particularly
against chastity, continual prayer is necessary. ” **_Watch ye, and pray, that ye enter not into
temptation."_** (Mark xiv. 38.) But how will the unchaste, who are always seeking to be
tempted, pray to God to deliver them from temptation? They sometimes, as St. Augustine
confessed of himself, even abstain from prayer, through fear of being heard and cured of the
disease, which they wish to continue. **_"I feared,"_** said the saint, **_"that you would soon hear
and heal the disease of concupiscence, which I wished to be satiated, rather than
extinguished."_** (Conf., lib. 8, cap. vii.) St. Peter calls this vice an unceasing sin. ” **_Having eyes
full of adultery and sin that ceaseth not."_** (2 Pet. ii. 14.) Impurity is called an unceasing sin on
account of the obstinacy which it induces. Some person addicted to this vice says: **_I always
confess the sin._** So much the worse; for since you always relapse into sin, these confessions
serve to make you persevere in the sin. The fear of punishment is diminished by saying: **_I
always confess the sin._** If you felt that this sin certainly merits hell, you would scarcely say: I
will not give it up; I do not care if I am damned. But the devil deceives you. Commit this sin,
he says; for you afterwards confess it. But, to make a good confession of your sins, you must
have true sorrow of the heart, and a firm purpose to sin no more. Where are this sorrow and
this firm purpose of amendment, when you always return to the vomit? If you had had these
dispositions, and had received sanctifying grace at your confessions, you should not have
relapsed, or at least you should have abstained for a considerable time from relapsing. You
have always fallen back into sin in eight or ten days, and perhaps in a shorter time, after
confession. What sign is this? It is a sign that you were always in enmity with God. If a sick
man instantly vomits the medicine which he takes, it is a sign that his disease is incurable.


8. St. Jerome says **_, that the vice of impurity, when habitual, will cease when the unhappy
man who indulges in it is cast into the fire of hell. ”infernal fire, lust, whose fuel is gluttony,
whose sparks are brief conversations, whose end is hell."_** The unchaste be come like the
vulture that waits to be killed by the fowler, rather than abandon the rottenness of the dead
bodies on which it feeds. This is what happened to a young female, who, after having lived in
the habit of sin with a young man, fell sick, and appeared to be converted. At the hour of
death she asked leave of her confessor to send for the young man, in order to exhort him to
change his life at the sight of her death. The confessor very imprudently gave the permission,
and taught her what she should say to her accomplice in sin. But listen to what happened. As



soon as she saw him, she forgot her promise to the confessor and the exhortation she was to
give to the young man. And what did she do? She raised herself up, sat in bed, stretched her
arms to him, and said: **_Friend, I have always loved you, and even now, at the end of my life, I
love you: I see that, on your account, I shall go to hell: but I do not care: I am willing, for the
love of you, to be damned._** After these words she fell back on the bed and expired. These facts
are related by Father Segneri (Christ. Istr. Bag., xxiv., n. 10.) Oh! how difficult is it for a
person who has contracted a habit of this vice, to amend his life and return sincerely to God!
O how difficult is it for him not to terminate this habit in hell, like the unfortunate young
woman of whom I have just spoken.


**_Second Point. Illusion of those who say that God takes pity on this sin._**



9. The votaries of lust say that God takes pity on this sin; but such is not the language of St.
Thomas of Villanova. **_He says, that in the sacred Scriptures we do not read of any sin so
severely chastised as the sin of impurity. ”Luxuriæ facinus præ aliis punitum legimus."_**
(Serm. iv., Dom. 1, Quadrag.) We find in the Scriptures, that in punishment of this sin, a
deluge of fire descended from heaven on four cities, and, in an instant, consumed not only
the inhabitants, but even the very stones. **_"And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah
brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he destroyed these cities, and all things
that spring from the earth."_** (Gen. xix. 24.) St. Peter Damian relates, that a man and a woman
who had sinned against impurity, were found burnt and black as a cinder.


10. Salvian writes, **_that it was in punishment of the sin of impurity that God sent on the
earth the universal deluge, which was caused by continued rain for forty days and forty
nights._** In this deluge the waters rose fifteen cubits above the tops of the highest mountains;
and only eight persons along with Noah were saved in the ark. The rest of the inhabitants of
the earth, who were more numerous then than at present, were punished with death in
chastisement of the vice of impurity. Mark the words of the Lord in speaking of this
chastisement which he inflicted on that sin: ” **_My spirit shall not remain in man for ever;
because he is flesh."_** (Gen. vi. 3.) **_"That is,"_** says Liranus, **_"too deeply involved in carnal sins."_**
The Lord added: ” **_For it repenteth me that I made man."_** (Gen. vi. 7.) The indignation of God
is not like ours, which clouds the mind, and drives us into excesses: his wrath is a judgment
perfectly just and tranquil, by which God punishes and repairs the disorders of sin. But to
make us understand the intensity of his hatred for the sin of impurity, he represents himself
as if sorry for having created man, who offended him so grievously by this vice. We, at the
present day, see more severe temporal punishment inflicted on this than on any other sin. Go
into the hospitals, and listen to the shrieks of so many young men, who, in punishment of
their impurities, are obliged to submit to the severest treatment and to the most painful
operations, and who, if they escape death, are, according to the divine threat, feeble, and
subject to the most excruciating pain for the remainder of their lives. ” **_Thou hast cast me off
behind thy back; bear thou also thy wickedness and thy fornications."_** (Ezec. xxiii. 35.)


11. St. Remigius writes that, if children.be excepted, the number of adults **_that are saved is
few, on account of the sins of the flesh. ”Exceptis parvulis ex adultis propter vitiam carnis
pauci salvantur."_** (Apud S. Cypr. de bono pudic.) In conformity with this doctrine, **_it was
revealed to a holy soul, that as pride has filled hell with devils, so impurity fills it with men._**
(Col., disp. ix., ex. 192.) St. Isidore assigns the reason. He says **_that there is no vice which so_**



**_much enslaves men to the devil as impurity. ”Magis per luxuriam, humanum genus subditur
diabolo, quam per aliquod aliud."_** (S. Isid., lib. 2, c. xxxix.) Hence, St. Augustine says, that
with regard to this sin, ” **_the combat is common and the victory rare."_** Hence it is, that on
account of this sin hell is filled with souls.



12. All that I have said on this subject has been said, not that any one present, who has been
addicted to the vice of impurity, may be driven to despair, but that such persons may be
cured. Let us, then, come to the remedies. These are two great remedies prayer, and the flight
of dangerous occasions. **_Prayer,_** says St. Gregory of Nyssa, **_is the safeguard of chastity.
"Oratio pudicitiæ præsidium et tutamen est."_** (De Orat.) And before him, Solomon, speaking
of himself, said the same. **_"And as I knew that I could not otherwise be continent, except God
gave it... I went to the Lord, and besought him."_** (Wis. viii. 21.) Thus, it is impossible for us to
conquer this vice without God’s assistance. Hence, as soon as temptation against chastity
presents itself, the remedy is, **_to turn instantly to God for help, and to repeat several times
the most holy names of Jesus and Mary, which have a special virtue to banish bad thoughts
of that kind. I have said immediately, without listening to, or beginning to argue with the
temptation. When a bad thought occurs to the mind, it is necessary to shake it off instantly,
as you would a spark that flies from the fire, and instantly to invoke aid from Jesus and
Mary._**


13. As to the flight of dangerous occasions, St. Philip Neri used to say that **_cowards that is,
they who fly from the occasions gain the victory_**. Hence you must, in the first place, keep a
restraint on the eyes, and must abstain from looking at young females. Otherwise, says St.
Thomas, you can scarcely avoid the sin**_. ”Luxuria vitari vix protest nisi vitatur aspectus
mulieris pulchræ."_** (S. Thom. 1, 2, qu. 167, a. 2.) Hence Job said: ” **_I made a covenant with my
eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin"_** (xxxi. 1). He was afraid to look at a
virgin; because from looks it is easy to pass to desires, and from desires to acts. St. Francis de
Sales used to say, **_that to look at a woman does not do so much evil as to look at her a
second time._** If the devil has not gained a victory the first, he will gain the second time. And if
it be necessary to abstain from looking at females, it is much more necessary to avoid
conversation with them. **_"Tarry not among women."_** (Eccl. xlii. 12.) We should be persuaded
that, in avoiding occasions of this sin, no caution can be too great. Hence we must be always
fearful, and fly from them. ” **_A wise man feareth and declineth from evil; a fool is confident."_**
(Prov. xiv. 16.) A wise man is timid, and flies away; a fool is confident, and falls.


**SERMON XLVI. SEVENTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE LOVE OF
GOD.**
**_"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart." MATT. xxii. 37._**


**_" BUT one thing is necessary."_** (Luke x. 42.) What is this one thing necessary? It is not
necessary to acquire riches, nor to ohtain dignities, nor to gain a great name. The only thing
necessary is to love God. Whatever is not done for the love of God is lost. This is the greatest
and the first commandment of the divine law. To the Pharisee who asked what is the greatest
commandment of the law, Jesus Christ answered: ” **_Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
thy whole heart .... This is the greatest and first commandment."_** (Matt. xxii. 37, 38.) But this,
which is the greatest of the commandments, is the most despised by men: there are few who
fulfil it. The greater part of men love their relatives, their friends, and even brute animals, but



do not love God. Of these St. John says that they have not life that they are dead. ” **_He that
loveth not, abideth in death."_** (I John iii. 14.) St. Bernard writes, **_that the reward of a soul is
estimated by the measure of her love for God. ”Quan-titas animæ æstimatur de mensura
charitatis quam habet."_** (Serm. xxvii., in Cant.) Let us consider today, in the first point, how
dear this command of loving God with our whole heart ought to be to us; and, in the second,
what we ought to do in order to love God with our whole heart.


**_First Point. How dear this command of loving God with our whole heart ought to be to us._**



1. What object more noble, more magnificent, more powerful, more rich, more beautiful,
more bountiful, more merciful, more grateful, more amiable, or more loving, than himself,
could God give us to love? Who more noble than God? Some boast of the nobility of their
family for five hundred or a thousand years; but the nobility of God is eternal. He is the Lord
of all. Before God all the angels in heaven or all the nobles on earth are but as a drop of water
or a grain of dust. ” **_Behold the Gentiles are as a drop of a bucket behold the islands are as a
little dust. ”_** (Isa. xl. 15.) Who more powerful than God? He can do whatsoever he wills. By
an act of his will he has created this world, and by another act he can destroy it when he
pleases. Who more wealthy? He possesses all the riches of heaven and earth. Who more
beautiful? Before the beauty of God all the beauties of creatures disappear. Who more
bountiful? St. Augustine says, **_that God has a greater desire to do good to us than we have to
receive it._** Who more merciful? If the most impious sinner on earth humble himself before
God, and repent of his sins, God instantly pardons and embraces him. Who more grateful?
He does not leave unrewarded the smallest act we perform for his sake. Who more amiable?
God is so amiable that, by barely seeing and loving him in heaven, the saints feel a joy which
makes them perfectly happy and content for all eternity. The greatest of the torments of the
damned arise from knowing that this God is so amiable, and that they cannot love him.


2. Finally, who more loving than God? In the Old Law, men might doubt whether God loved
them with a tender love; but, after seeing him die on a cross for us, how can we doubt of the
tenderness and the ardent affection with which he loves us? Let us raise our eyes and look at
Jesus, the true Son of God, fastened with nails to a gibbet, and let us consider the intensity of
the ove which he bears us. **_The cross, the wounds,_** says St. Bernard, **_cry out, and proclaim to
us that he truly loves us. "Clamat crux, clamat vulnus, quod ipse vere dilexit."_** And what
more could he do to convince us of his great love than to lead a life of sorrow for thirty- three
years, and afterwards die in torments on the infamous tree of the cross, in order to wash
away our sins with his own blood?” **_Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself up
for us." (Eph. v. 2.)”Who hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood."_**
(Apoc. i. 5.)” **_How,"_** says St. Philip Neri, ” **_is it possible for him who believes in God to love
anything but God ?"_** Contemplating God’s love towards men, St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi
**_began one day to ring the bell, saying that she wished to invite all the nations of the earth to
love so loving a God. St. Francis de Sales used to say with tears: "To love our God it would
be necessary to have an infinite love; and we throw away our love on vain, contemptible
things."_**


3. O! inestimable value of divine love, which makes us rich before God! It is the treasure by
which we gain his friendship. " **_he is an infinite treasure to men, which they that use become
the friends of God."_** (Wis. vii. 14.) The only thing we ought to fear, says St. Gregory of Nyssa



(de Vita Moysis), **_is the loss of God‟s friendship; and the only object of our desires should be
its attainment. ”Unum terribile, arbitror, ab amicitia Dei repelli: unum solum expectibile,
amicitia Dei."_** It is love that obtains the friendship of God. Hence, according to St. Lawrence
Justinian, by love the poor become rich, and without love the rich are poor. ” **_No greater
riches than to have charity. In charity the poor man is rich, and without charity the rich man
is poor."_** (S. Laur. Just, in Matt. xiii. 44.) How great is the joy which a person feels in thinking
that he is loved by a man of exalted rank! But how much greater must be the consolation
which a soul derives from the conviction that God loves her!” **_I love them that love me."_**
(Prov. viii. 17.) In a soul that loves God the Three Persons of the Adorable Trinity dwell. ” **_If
any one love me he will keep my word; and my Father will love him; and we will come to
him, and will make our abode with him."_** (John xiv. 23.) St. Bernard writes, that among all the
virtues **_charity is the one that unites us to God. Charitas est virtus conjungens nos Deo."_** St.
Catherine of Bologna used to say, **_that love is the golden chain that binds the soul to God_**. St.
Augustine says, that” **_love is a joint connecting the lover with the beloved."_** Hence, were God
not immense, where should he be found? Find a soul that loves God, and there God is
certainly found. Of this St. John assures us. **_“He that abideth in charity abideth in God, and
God in him."_** (1 John iv. 16.) A poor man loves riches, but he does not therefore enjoy them;
he may love a throne, but he does not therefore possess a kingdom. But the man that loves
God possesses God. ” **_He abideth in God, and God in him. ”_**



4. Besides, St. Thomas says (Tr. de Virt, art. 3), **_that love draws in its train all other virtues,
and directs them all to unite us more closely to God. Hence, because from charity all virtues
are born,_** St. Lawrence Justinian **_called it the mother of virtues._** Hence, St. Augustine used to
say: ” **_Love, and do what you wish."_** He that loves God can only do what is good; if he does
evil, he shows that he has ceased to love God. And when he ceases to love him, all things can
profit him nothing. If, said the Apostle, I give all my possessions to the poor, and my body to
the flames, and have not charity, I am nothing. ” **_And if I should distribute all my goods to
feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth
me nothing."_** (1 Cor. xiii. 3.)


5. Love also prevents us from feeling the pains of this life. St. Bonaventure says, **_that the love
of God is like honey; it sweetens things the most bitter._** And what more sweet to a soul that
loves God than to suffer for him? She knows that by cheerfully embracing sufferings she
pleases God, and that her pains shall be the brightest jewels in her crown in Paradise. And
who is there that will not willingly suffer and die in imitation of Jesus Christ, who has gone
before us, carrying his cross, to offer himself in sacrifice for the love of us, and inviting us to
follow his example**_? "If any man will come after me, let him take up his cross and follow
me."_** (Matt. xvi. 24.) For this purpose he has condescended to humble himself to death, and to
the opprobrious death of the cross, for the love of us. ” **_He humbled himself, becoming
obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross."_** (Phil. ii. 8.)


**_Second Point What we ought to do in order to love God with our whole heart._**


6. St. Teresa used to say, that **_in calling a soul to his love, God bestows upon her an
exceedingly great favour._** Since, then, most beloved brethren, God calls us all to his love, let
us thank and love him with our whole heart. Because he loves us intensely, he wishes to he
tenderly loved by us. ” **_When, ”_** says St. Bernard, ” **_God loves, he desires nothing else than to_**



**_he loved; for he loves only that he may be loved."_** (Serm. lxiii., in Cant.) It was to inflame us
with his divine love that the Eternal Word descended from heaven. So he himself has
declared; adding, that he only desires to see this fire lighted up in our hearts. ” **_I am come to
cast fire on the earth, and what will I but that it be kindled?"_** (Luke xii. 49.) Let us now see
what means we ought to adopt in order to love God.



7. In the first place, we ought to guard against every sin, whether mortal or venial. ” **_If, ”_** says
Jesus Christ, ” **_any one love me, he will keep my word."_** (John xiv. 23.) The first mark of love is
to endeavour not to give the smallest displeasure to the beloved. How can he be said to love
God with his whole heart, who is not afraid to commit deliberate venial offences against
God? St. Teresa used to say to her spiritual children: ” **_From deliberate sin, however small,
may God deliver you."_** But some will say: **_Venial sin is a small evil._** Is it a small evil to
displease a God who is so good, and who loves us so tenderly?


8. In the second place, to love God with the whole heart, it is necessary to have a great desire
to love him. Holy desires are the wings with which we fly to God; for, as St. Lawrence
Justinian says, **_a good desire gives us strength to go forward, and lightens the labour of
walking in the way of God. ”Vires subministrat, posnam exhibet leviorem."_** According to the
spiritual masters, he that does not advance in the way of the Lord goes back; but, on the other
hand, God cheerfully gives himself to those who seek after him. ” **_The Lord is good to the soul
that seeketh him."_** (Lamen. iii. 25.) He fills with his own good things all who desire him
through love. ” **_He hath filled the hungry with good things."_** (Luke i. 53.)


9. In the third place, it is necessary to resolve courageously, to arrive at the perfect love of
God. Some persons desire to belong entirely to God, but do not resolve to adopt the means. It
is of them the Wise Man says, ” **_Desires kill the soul."_** (Prov. xxi. 25.) I would wish, they say,
to become a saint; but still, with all their desires, they never advance a single step. St. Teresa
used to say, that” **_of these irresolute souls the devil is never afraid."_** Because, if they do not
resolve sincerely to give themselves to God without reserve, they shall always continue in the
same imperfections. But, on the other hand, the saint says, that God wishes only from us a
true resolution to become saints; he himself will do the rest. If, then, we wish to love God
with our whole heart, we must resolve to do without reserve what is most pleasing to him,
and to begin at once to put our hands to the work. ” **_Whatsoever thy hand is able to do, do it
earnestly."_** (Eccl. ix. 10.) What you can do Today do not put off till to-morrow; do it as soon
as possible. A certain nun in the convent of Tori degli Speechi, in Rome, led a tepid life; but,
being called by God, in a retreat, to his perfect love, she resolved to correspond immediately
to the divine call, and said to her director, with a sincere resolution: ” **_Father, I wish to
become a saint, and to become one immediately."_** And from that moment, with the aid of
God’s grace, she lived and died a saint. We must, then, resolve to acquire the perfect love of
God, and must immediately adopt the means of becoming saints.


10. The first means is, to detach the heart from all creatures, and to banish from the soul
every affection which is not for God. The first question which the ancient fathers of the desert
put to every one who sought admission into their society was: **_"Do you bring an empty heart,
that the Holy Ghost may be able to fill it ?" If_** the world be not expelled from the heart, God
cannot enter it. St. Teresa used to say: **_"Detach the heart from creatures; seek God, and you
shall find him."_** St. Augustine writes, that the Romans worshipped thirty thousand gods; but,



among these gods the Roman Senate refused to admit Jesus Christ. **_Because, said they, he is a
proud God, who requires that he alone should be adored._** This they had reason to say; for our
God wishes to possess our whole souls. **_He is,_** as St. Jerome says, **_a jealous God. ”Zelotypus
est Jesus."_** And therefore lie will have no rival in the affections of our heart. Hence, the
Spouse in the Canticles is called **_"an enclosed garden." "My sister, my spouse is an enclosed
garden."_** (Cant. iv. 12.) The soul, then, that wishes to belong entirely to God, must be shut
against all love which is not for God.



11. Hence the Divine Spouse is said to be wounded by one of the eyes of his eyes. ” **_Thou hast
wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast wounded my heart with one of thy eyes."_**
(Cant. iv. 9.) One of her eyes signifies, that in all her thoughts and actions the only end of the
spouse is to please God; while, in their devout exercises, worldlings propose to themselves
different objects sometimes their own interest, sometimes to please their friends, and
sometimes to please themselves. But the saints seek only to please God, to whom they turn,
and say: ” **_What have I in heaven? and, besides thee, what do I desire upon earth? Thou art
the God of my heart, and the God that is my portion for ever."_** (Ps. Ixxii. 25, 26.) We should
do the same if we wished to be saints. **_If,_** says St. Chrysostom, **_we do some things pleasing to
God, what else but his pleasure do we seek? "Si dignus fueris agere aliquid, quod Deo placet,
aliam præter id mercedem requiris ?"_** (Lib. 2, de Compunct. Cord.) What greater reward can a
creature obtain than to please its Creator? Hence, in all we desire or do, we should seek
nothing but God. A certain solitary, called Zeno, walking through the desert, absorbed in
thought, met the Emperor Macedonius going to hunt. The emperor asked him what he was
doing. In answer, the solitary said: **_You go in quest of animals, and I seek God alone._** St.
Francis de Sales used to say, **_that the pure love of God consumes all that is not God._**


12. Moreover, to love God with our whole heart, it is necessary tolove him without reserve.
Hence we must love him with a love of preference. We must prefer him before every other
good, and must be resolved to lose a thousand lives, rather than forfeit his friendship. We
must say with St. Paul: **_Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God."_** (Rom. viii. 38, 39.) We must also love him with a love of benevolence,
desiring to see him loved by all: and therefore, if we love God, we should seek as much as
possible to kindle in others the fire of his love, or, at least, should pray for the conversion of
all who do not love him. We must love him with a love of sorrow, regretting every offence
offered to him more than every evil which we could suffer. We must love him with a love of
conformity to the divine will. The principal office of love is to unite the will of lovers, and to
make the soul say: **_"Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?"_** (Acts ix. 6.) Lord, tell me what
thou dost wish from me; I desire to do it. I wish for nothing; I wish only what thou wiliest.
Hence, we ought frequently to offer ourselves to God without reserve, that he may do with
us, and with all we have, whatever he pleases. We must love God with a love of patience.
This is that strong love by which true lovers are known. ” **_Love is strong as death."_** (Cant. viii.
6.) **_"There is nothing too difficult,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_to be conquered by the fire of love."_**
(Lib. De Mor. Eccl, c. xxii.) For, adds the saint, **_in doing what we love, labour is not felt, or, if
it be felt, the very labour is loved. "In eo quod arnatur, aut non laboratur, aut labor amatur."_**
St. Vincent of Paul used to say, **_that love is measured by the desire of the soul to suffer and be
humbled, in order to please God_**. Let God be pleased, though it should cost us the loss of our
life and of all things. To gain all, it is necessary to leave all. **_All for all,_** said Thomas a Kempis.



The reason we do not become saints is, as St. Teresa says, **_because, as we do not give God all
our affections, so he does not give us his perfect love._** We must then say with tbe spouse in
the Canticles: **_"My beloved to me, and I to him."_** (Cant. ii. 1 6.) My beloved has given himself
entirely to me: it is but just that I give myself without reserve to him. St. John Chrysostom
says, **_that when a soul has given herself entirely to God, she no longer cares for ignominies
and sufferings; she loses the desire of all things; and not finding repose in any creature, she is
always in search cf her beloved; her sole concern is to find her beloved._**


13. To obtain and to preserve divine love, three things are necessary: meditation,
communion, and prayer. First, meditation is necessary. He who thinks but little on God,
loves him but little. **_“In my meditation, ”_** says David, **_"a fire shall flame out."_** (Ps. xxxviii. 4.)
Meditation, and particularly meditation on the passion of Jesus Christ, is the blessed furnace
in which the love of God is kindled and fanned. " **_He brought me into the wine cellar; he set in
order charity in me. ”_** (Cant. ii. 4.) The souls that are introduced into this heavenly cellar, by a
single glance of Jesus Christ crucified and dying for the love of us, are wounded and
inebriated with holy love. For St. Paul says, that Jesus Christ died for us all, that each of us
may live only to love him. ” **_And Christ died for all, that they also may not now live to
themselves, but unto him who died for them. ”_** (2 Cor. v. 15.) The communion is another holy
furnace, in which we are inflamed with divine love. ”The holy eucharist, ” says St.
Chrysostom, ” **_is a fire which inflames us, that, like lions breathing fire, we may retire from
the holy table, being made terrible to the devil. ”_** (Hom, xli., ad Pop.) Above all, prayer **_(the
prayer of petition)_** is necessary. It is by means of prayer that God dispenses all his favours,
but particularly the great gift of divine love. To make us ask this love, meditation is a great
help. **_"Without meditation we shall ask little or nothing from God. "_** We must, then, always,
every day, and several times in the day, ask God to give us the grace to love him with our
whole heart. St. Gregory says, **_that God wishes to be compelled and importuned by our
petitions to bestow upon us his graces. ”God wishes to be entreated to be compelled: he
wishes in a certain manner to be overcome by importunity."_** Let us, then, continually ask of
Jesus Christ his holy love; and let us ask his divine mother Mary, **_who is the treasurer of all
his graces, to obtain it for us. Thesauraria gratiarum (Idiota)._** She is called by St. Bernardino,
the dispensatrix of God’s graces. ” **_All graces are dispensed through her hands."_** t is through
her intercession that we must obtain the great gift of divine love.


**SERMON XLVII. EIGHTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON BAD
THOUGHTS.**
**_" And Jesus seeing their thoughts, said: Why do you think evil in your hearts." MATT. ix. 4._**


IN the gospel of this day it is related that a paralytic was presented te Jesus Christ that he
might heal him. The Lord healed not only his body, but also his soul, and said to him **_: ”Be of
good heart, son; thy sins are forgiven thee"_** (verse 2). Some of the Scribes, as soon as they
heard these words, said in their hearts: **_He blasphemeth._** But our Saviour soon let them know
that he saw their evil thoughts, saying: **_"Why do you think evil in your hearts. ”_** Let us come
to the subject of this discourse. God sees the most secret evil thoughts of our hearts; he sees
and punishes them. Human judges forbid and chastise only external crimes; for men only see
what appears externally. ” **_Men seeth those things that appear; but the Lord beholdeth the
heart."_** (1 Kings xvi. 7.) God prohibits and punishes bad thoughts. We shall examine, in the



first point, when bad thoughts are sinful; in the second, the great danger of bad thoughts
when indulged; and in the third, the remedies against bad thoughts.


**_First Point. When bad thoughts are sinful._**



1. In two ways men err regarding bad thoughts. Some who have the fear of God, are
scrupulous, and are afraid that every bad thought that presents itself to the mind is a sin.
This is an error. It is not the bad thought, but the consent to it, that is sinful. All the malice of
mortal sin consists in a bad will, in giving to a sin a perfect consent, with full advertence to
the malice of the sin. Hence St. Augustine teaches, **_that where there is no consent there can be
no sin. ”Nullo modo sit peccatum, si non sit voluntarium."_** (De Vera Rel, cap. xiv.) Though
the temptation, the rebellion of the senses, or the evil motion of the inferior parts, should be
very violent, there is no sin, as long as there is no consent. ” **_Non nocet sensus,"_** says St.
Bernard, ” **_ubi non est consensus."_** (De Inter. Domo., cap. xix.)


2. Even the saints have been tormented by temptations. The devil labours harder to make the
saints fall, than to make the wicked sin: he regards the saints as more valuable prey. The
Prophet Habacuc says, that the saints are the dainty food of the enemy. ” **_Through them his
portion is made fat, and his meat dainty."_** (Hab. i. 16.) And therefore, the prophet adds, that
the evil one stretches out his net for all, to deprive them of the life of grace: and that he spares
no one. **_"For this cause, therefore, he spreadeth out his net, and will not spare continually to
slay the nations. ”_** (Ibid., v. 17.) Even St. Paul, after he had been made a vessel of election,
groaned under temptations against chastity. ” **_There was,"_** said he, **_"given me a sting of the
flesh, an angel of Satan to afflict me."_** (2 Cor. xii. 7.) He three times prayed to the Lord, to
deliver him from these temptations; but in answer the Lord told him, that his grace was
sufficient for him. ” **_For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me.
And he said: My grace is sufficient for thee."_** (ver. 8, 9.) God permits even his servants to be
tempted, as well to try their fidelity, as to purify them from their imperfections. And, for the
consolation of timid and scrupulous souls, I will here state that, according to the common
opinion of theologians, when a soul that fears God and hates sin is in doubt whether she gave
consent to a bad thought, she is not bound, as long as she is not certain of having given
consent, to confess it: for it is then morally certain that she has not consented to it. Had she
really fallen into grevious sin she would have no doubt about it; for mortal sin is so horrible a
monster, that it is impossible for him who fears God to admit it into the soul without his
knowledge.


3. Others, who are not scrupulous, but are ignorant, and have lax consciences, think that evil
thoughts, though wilfully indulged, are not mortal sins, unless the act is consummated. This
is an error worse than the former. What we cannot lawfully do, we cannot lawfully desire.
Hence it is, that a bad thought to which a person consents, has the same malice as the bad act.
As sinful works separate us from God, so also do sinful thoughts. ” **_Perverse thoughts
separate us from God."_** (Wis. i. 3.) And as all bad actions are known to God, so also he sees
all evil thoughts, and will condemn and punish them. ” **_The Lord is a God of all knowledge,
and to him are thoughts prepared."_** (1 Kings ii. 3.)


4. However, all bad thoughts are not equally sinful: nor have all those that are sinful equal
malice. In a bad thought we may consider three things: the suggestion, the delectation, and



the consent. The suggestion is the first bad thought that is presented to the mind: this is no
sin, but, when rejected is an occasion of merit. ” **_As often,"_** says St. Antonine, ” **_as you resist,
you are crowned."_** The delectation takes place when the person stops, as it were, to look at
the bad thought, which by its pleasing appearance, causes delight. Unless the will consents to
it, this delectation is not a mortal sin; but it is a venial sin, and, if not resisted, the soul is in
danger of consenting to it: but, when this danger is not proximate, the sin is only venial. But
it is necessary to remark, that, when the thought which excites the delight is against chastity,
we are, according to the common opinion of theologians, bound under pain of mortal sin to
give a positive resistance to the delectation caused by the thought; because, if not resisted, the
delight easily obtains the consent of the will. ” **_Unless a person repel delectations,"_** says St.
Anselm, ” **_the delight passes to consent_** , **_and kills the soul."_** (S. Ans. Simil., c. xl.) Hence,
though a person should not consent to the sin, if he delight in the obscene object, and do not
endeavour to resist the delectation, he is guilty of a mortal sin, by exposing himself to the
proximate danger of consent. ” **_How long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee."_** (Jer. iv. 14.)
Why, says the Prophet, do you allow hurtful thoughts to remain in the mind? Why do you
not make an effort to banish them from the heart? God wishes us to watch over the heart
with great care; because on the heart that is, the will our life depends. ” **_With all watchfulness
keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it."_** (Prov. iv. 23.) Finally, the consent, which is
the cause of mortal sin, takes place when the person clearly knows that the object is mortally
sinful, and embraces it perfectly with the will.



5. A person may sin grievously by thought in two ways; by desire, and by complacency. A
person sins by desire when he wishes to do the bad act which he desires, or would wish to do
it if he had the opportunity: the desire is a mortal or a venial sin, according as the act which
he desires to do is mortally or venially sinful. However, in practice, the commission of the
external act always increases the malice of the will, either because it ordinarily increases the
complacency which the will indulges, or causes it to continue for a longer time. Hence, if the
act followed, it is necessary to mention it in confession. A person sins by complacency, when
he does not desire to commit the sinful act, but delights in it as if he had committed it. This
complacency is called morose delectation. It is called morose, not because the complacency in
the thought of the unchaste acts lasts for a considerable time, but because the will dwells with
delight on the thought. Hence, **_the sin of complacency may_** , as St. Thomas teaches, **_be
committed in a moment_**. ” **_Dicitur morosa,"_** says the holy doctor, ” **_non ex mora temporis, sed
ex eo quod ratio deliberans circa earn immoratur revolvens libenter quoo statim respui
debuerent."_** (1, 2, qu. 74, a 1 ad. 3.) He says” **_libenter”(wilfully)_** to remove scruples from
persons of timorous conscience, who suffer against their will certain carnal motions and
delights, although they do all in their power to banish them. Though the inferior part should
feel a certain delight, as long as the will does not consent, there is no sin, at least no mortal
sin. I repeat with St. Augustine, **_that what is not voluntary is by no means sinful. ”Malum
nullo modo sit peccatum, si non sit voluntarium."_** (De Vera Rel., c. xiv.) In temptations
against chastity, the spiritual masters advise us, not so much to contend with the bad
thought, as to turn the mind to some spiritual, or, at least, indifferent object. It is useful to
combat other bad thoughts face to face, but not thoughts of impurity.


**_Second Point. The great danger of bad thoughts._**





6. It is necessary to guard with all possible caution against all bad thoughts, which are an
abomination to God. ” **_Evil thoughts are an abomination to the Lord. ”_** (Prov. xv. 26.) They
are called "an abomination to the Lord," because, as the holy Council of Trent says, **_bad
thoughts, particularly thoughts against the ninth and tenth commandments, sometimes
inflict on the soul a deeper wound, and are more dangerous than external acts.
”Nonnunquam animam gravius sauciant, et periculosiora sunt iis quæ in manifesto
admittuntur."_** (Sess. 14, de Pæna, cap. v.) They are more dangerous on many accounts; first,
because sins of thought are more easily committed than sins of action. The occasions of sinful
acts are frequently wanting; but sins of thought are committed without the occasion. When a
soul has turned her back on God, the heart is continually intent on evil, which causes delight,
and thus multiplies sins without number. ” **_All the thought of their heart was bent upon evil
at all times."_** (Gen. vi. 5.)


7. Secondly, at the hour of death sinful actions cannot be committed; but we may then be
guilty of sins of thought; and he who has had a habit of consenting to bad thoughts during
life, will be in danger of indulging them at death; for then the temptations of the devil are
most violent, Knowing that he has but little time to gain the soul he makes great efforts to
bring her into sin. ” **_The devil is come down unto you, hav ing great wrath, knowing that he
hath but a short time. ”_** (Apoc. xii. 12.) Being in danger of death, St. Eleazar, as Surius relates,
was so severely tempted with bad thoughts, that, after his recovery, he said: ” **_Oh! how great
is the power of the devils at the hour of death!"_** The saint conquered the temptations,
because he was accustomed to reject bad thoughts. But miserable the man that has contracted
the habit of committing them. Father Segneri relates that a certain sinner indulged evil
thoughts during life. At death he made a sincere confession of all his sins, and was truly
sorry for them; but, after death, he appeared to a person and said he was damned. He stated,
that his confession was valid, and that God had pardoned all his sins: that, before death, the
devil represented to him, that should he recover from his illness, it would be an act of
ingratitude to forsake a certain woman who had a great affection for him. He banished the
first temptation: a second came, which he also rejected; but having continued to think on it
for a little, he was tempted a third time, yielded to the temptation, and thus he was lost.


**_Third Point. On the remedies against had thoughts._**


8. The Prophet Isaias says, that to be freed from bad thoughts, we must take away the evil of
our thoughts. ” **_Take away the evil of our devices."_** (Isa. i. 16.) What does he mean by taking
away the evil of our devices? He means that we should take away the occasions of evil
thoughts, avoid dangerous occasions, and keep at a distance from bad company. I knew a
young man who was an angel; but, in consequence of a word which he heard from a bad
companion he had an evil thought, and consented to it. He was of opinion that this was the
only grievous sin which he committed in his whole life; for he afterwards became a religious,
and, after some years, died a holy death. Thus, it is also necessary to abstain from reading
books that are obscene, or other wise bad. You must, moreover, avoid dances with females
and profane comedies: at least when the dances or comedies are immodest.


9. Some young men will ask: **_Father, is it sinful to make love?_** I say: **_I cannot assert that of
itself it is a mortal sin; but persons who do so are often in the proximate occasion of mortal
sin; and experience shows that few of them are found free from grievous faults._** It is useless



for them to say that they neither had a bad motive nor bad thoughts. This is an illusion of the
devil; in the beginning he does not suggest bad thoughts; but when, by frequent
conversations together, and by frequently speaking of love, the affection of these lovers has
become strong, the devil will make them blind to the danger and sinfulness of their conduct,
and they shall find that, without knowing how, they have lost their souls and God by many
sins of impurity and scandal. Oh! how many young persons of both sexes does the devil gain
in this way! And of all those sins of scandal God will demand an account of fathers and
mothers, who are bound, but neglect, to prevent these dangerous conversations. Hence, they
are the cause of all these evils, and shall be severely chastised by God for them.



10. Above all, in order to avoid bad thoughts, men must abstain from looking at women, and
females must be careful not to look at men. I repeat the words of Job which I have frequently
quoted: ” **_I made a covenant with my eyes, that I should not so much as think upon a virgin."_**
(Job xxxi. 1.) He says that he made a covenant with his eyes that he would not think. What
have the eyes to do with thinking? The eyes do not think; the mind alone thinks. But he had
just reason to say that he made a covenant with his eyes that he would not think on women;
for St. Bernard says, **_that through the eyes the darts of impure love, which kills the soul, enter
into the mind. ”Per oculos intrat in mentem sagitta impuri amoris."_** Hence the Holy Ghost
says: “ **_Turn away thy face from a woman dressed up."_** (Eccl. ix. 8.) It is always dangerous to
look at young persons elegantly dressed; and to look at them purposely, and without a just
cause, is, at least, a venial sin.


11. When thoughts against chastity, which often occur without any immediate occasion,
present themselves, it is, as I have said, necessary to banish them at once, without beginning
to argue with the temptation. The instant you perceive the thought reject it, without giving
ear to it, or examining what it says or represents to you. It is related in the book of the
sentences of the fathers, ( 4 ), that St. Pachomius one day saw a devil boasting that he often
made a certain monk fall into sin; because, when tempted, the monk, instead of turning to
God, listened to his suggestions, and began to reason with the temptations. But the saint
heard another devil complaining, that he could gain nothing from the monk whom he
tempted; because the monk immediately had recourse to God for help, and thus he was
always victorious. This is the advice of St. Jerome: **_As soon as lust shall suggest evil, let us
exclaim: The Lord is my helper. ”Statim ut libido titillaverit sensum, erumpamus in vocem:
Domine auxiliator meus."_** (Epist. 22, ad Eustoch.)


12. Should the temptation continue it will be very useful to make it known to your confessor.
St Philip Neri used to say, that” **_a temptation disclosed is half conquered."_** In assaults of
impurity, some saints have had recourse to very severe mortifications. St. Benedict rolled his
naked body among thorns. St. Peter of Alcantara threw himself into a frozen pool. But I
consider the best means of overcoming these temptations to be, to have recourse to God, who
will certainly give us the victory. ” **_Praising, I will call on the Lord,"_** said David, ” **_and I shall
be saved from my enemies."_** (Ps. xvii. 4.) And when, after asking aid from God, the
temptation continues, we must not cease to pray, but must multiply prayers: we must sigh
and groan before the most holy sacrament in the chapel, or before a crucifix in our own room,
or before some image of most holy Mary, who is the mother of purity. It is true, all our efforts
are useless unless God sustains us by his own hand; but he sometimes requires these efforts
on our part, that he may supply our deficiency, and secure to us the victory. In such combats



with hell, it is useful in the beginning to renew our purpose never to offend God, and to
forfeit life rather than lose his grace; and then, we must make repeated petitions to him,
saying: Lord give me strength to resist this temptation: do not permit me to be separated
from thee: deprive me of life rather than allow me to lose thee.


**SERMON XLVIII. NINETEENTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE PAIN OF
LOSS WHICH THE DAMNED SUFFER IN HELL.**
**_" Cast him into the exterior darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." MATT.
xxii. 13._**


ACCORDING to all laws, divine and human, the punishment of crime should be
proportioned to its grievousness. **_"According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also
of the stripes be."_** (Deut. xxv. 2.) Now, the principal injury which sinners do to God by mortal
sin, consists in turning their back upon their Creator and their sovereign good. St. Thomas
defines mortal sin to be” **_a turning away from the immutable good"_** (p. 1, qu. 24, art. 4). Of
this injury the Lord complains in the following words: ” **_Thou hast forsaken me, saith the
Lord; thou hast gone backward. ”_** (Jer. xv. 6.) Since, then, the greatest guilt of the sinner
consists in deliberately consenting to lose God, the loss of God shall constitute his greatest
punishment in hell. ” **_There shall be weeping."_** In hell there is continual weeping; but what is
the object of the bitterest tears of the unhappy damned? It is the thought af having lost God
through their own fault. This shall be the subject of the present discourse. Be attentive,
brethren.



1. No! dearly beloved Christians! the goods of the earth are not the end for which God has
placed you in the world; the end for which he has created you is the attainment of eternal life.
” **_And the end life eternal."_** (Rom. vi. 22.) Eternal life consists in loving God, and possessing
him for eternity. Whosoever attains this end shall be for ever happy; but he who, through his
own fault, does not attain it, loses God; he shall be miserable for eternity, and shall weep for
ever, saying: ” **_My end is perished."_** (Lamen. iii. 18.)


2. The pain produced by loss is proportioned to the value of what has been lost. If a person
lose a jewel a diamond worth a hundred crowns, he feels great pain; if the diamond were
worth two hundred crowns, the pain is double; if worth four hundred, the pain is still
greater. Now, I ask, what is the good which a damned soul has lost? She has lost God; she has
lost an infinite good. The pain, then, arising from the loss of God is an infinite pain**_. ”The pain
of the damned,"_** says St. Thomas, ” **_is infinite, because it is the loss of an infinite good."_** (1. 2,
qu. 87, a. 4.) Such, too, is the doctrine of St. Bernard, who says, that the value of the loss of the
damned is measured from the infinitude of God the supreme good. Hence, hell does not
consist in its devouring fire, nor in its intolerable stench, nor in the unceasing shrieks and
bowlings of the damned, nor in the terrific sight of the devils, nor in the narrowness of that
pit of torments, in which the damned are thrown one over the other: the pain which
constitutes hell is the loss of God. In comparison of this pain, all the other torments of hell are
trifling. The reward of God’s faithful servants in heaven is, as he said to Abraham, God
himself. ” **_I am thy reward, exceeding great."_** (Gen. xv. 1.) Hence, as God is the reward of the
blessed in heaven, so the loss of God is the punishment of the damned in hell.





3. Hence, St. Bruno has truly said, that how great soever the torments which may be inflicted
on the damned, they never can equal the great pain of being deprived of God. **_Add torments
to torments, but do not deprive them of God. ”Addantur tormenta tormentis, et Deo non
priventur."_** (Serm. de Jud. Fin.) According to St. Chrysostom, **_a thousand hells are not equal
to this pain. Speaking of the loss of God, he said: ”Si mille dixeris gehennas, nihil par dices
illius doloris."_** (Hom, xlix., ad Pop.) God is so lovely that he deserves infinite love. He is so
amiable that the saints in heaven are so replenished with joy, and so absorbed in divine love,
that they desire nothing but to love God, and think only of loving him with all their strength.
At present, sinners, for the sake of their vile pleasures, shut their eyes, and neither know God
nor the love which he deserves; but in hell they shall, in punishment of their sins, be made to
know that God is an infinite good and infinitely amiable. ” **_The Lord shall be known when he
executeth judgment."_** (Ps. ix. 17.) The sinner, drowned in sensual pleasures, scarcely knows
God: he sees him only in the dark, and therefore he disregards the loss of God. But in hell he
shall know God, and shall be tormented for ever by the thought of having voluntarily lost his
infinite good. **_A certain Parisian doctor appeared after death to his bishop, and said that he
was damned. His bishop asked him if he remembered the sciences in which he was so well
versed in this life. He answered, that in hell the damned think only of the pain of having lost
God._**


4. ” **_Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire. ”_** (Matt. xxv. 41.) **_“Depart from me."_** This
command constitutes the hell of the damned. Begone from me; you shall be no longer mine,
and I shall be no longer yours. ” **_You are not my people, and I will not be yours."_** (Osee i. 9.)
**_At present this punishment is,_** as St. Augustine says, **_dreaded only by the saints. ”Hæc
amantibus non contemnentibus pœna est."_** It is a punishment which affrights the soul that
loves God more than all the torments of hell; but it does not terrify sinners, who are
immersed in the darkness of sin. But at death they shall, for their greater chastisement,
understand the infinite good which they have lost through their own fault.


5. It is necessary to know that men have been created for God, and that nature draws them to
love him. In this life, the darkness of sin, and the earthly affections which reign in their
hearts, stifle their natural tendency and inclination to a union with God, their sovereign
good; and therefore the thought of being separated from him does not produce much pain.
But when the soul leaves the body, and is freed from the senses, which keeps her in darkness,
she then clearly sees that she has been created for God, and that he is the only good which
can make her happy. ” **_But,"_** says St. Antonine, ” **_the soul separated from the body
understands that God is her sovereign good, and that she has been created for him."_** Hence,
as soon as she is loosed from the bondage of the body, she rushes forward to embrace her
supreme good: but because she is in sin, and his enemy, God will cast her off. Though driven
back and chased away, she retains her invincible tendency and inclination to a union with
God; and her hell shall consist in seeing herself always drawn to God, and always banished
from him.


6. If a dog see a hare, what effort does he not make to break his chain and seize his prey!
Thus, at her separation from the body, the natural inclinations of the soul draw her to God,
while at the same time sin separates her from him, and drags her with it into hell. Sin, says
the prophet, like a wall of immense thickness, is placed between the soul and God, and
separates her from him. ” **_But your iniquities have divided between you and your God."_** (Isa.



lix. 2.) Hence, the unhappy soul, confined in the prison of hell, at a distance from God, shall
weep for ever, saying: Then, my God, I shall be no longer thine, and thou wilt be no longer
mine. I shall love thee no more, and thou will never again love me. This separation from God
terrified David, when he said: ” **_Will God, then, cast off for ever? or will he never be more
favourable again ?"_** (Ps. Ixxvi. 8.) How great, he says, would be my misery if God should cast
me from him, and never again be merciful to me! But this misery every damned soul in hell
suffers, and shall suffer for eternity. As long as he remained in sin, David felt his conscience
reproaching him, and asking, ” **_Where is thy God ?"_** David, where is thy God, who once loved
thee? Thou hast lost him; he is no longer thine. David was so afflicted at the loss of his God
that he wept night and day. ” **_My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it has been
said to me daily: Where is thy God ?"_** (Ps. xli. 4.) Thus, even the devils will say to the
damned: Where is your God? By his tears David appeased and recovered his God; but the
damned shall shed an immense sea of tears, and shall never appease nor recover their God.



7. St. Augustine says, that if the damned saw the beauty of God, **_"they should feel no pain,
and hell itself would be converted into a Paradise."_** (Lib. de Trip. Hab.) But the damned shall
never see God. When David forbade his son Absalom to appear in his presence, the sorrow of
Absalom was so great, that he entreated Joab to tell his father that he would rather be put to
death than never more be permitted to see his face. ” **_I beseech thee, therefore, that I may see
the face of the king; and if he be mindful of my iniquity, let him kill me."_** (2 Kings xiv. &lt;32.)
To a certain grandee, who acted irreverently in the church, Philip the Second said: ” **_Do not
dare ever to appear again in my presence."_** So intense was the pain which the nobleman felt,
that after having returned home, he died of grief. What then must be the feelings of the
reprobate at the hour of death, when God shall say to them: Begone; let me never see you
again: you shall never more see my face!” **_I will hide my face from them; all evils and
afflictions shall find them."_** (Deut. xxxi. 17.) What sentiments of pity should we feel at seeing
a son who was always united with his father, who always eat and slept with him, weeping
over a parent whom he loved so tenderly, and saying: **_My father, I have lost you; I shall
never see you more._** Ah! if we saw a damned soul weeping bitterly, and asked her the cause
of her wailing, **_she would answer: I weep because I have lost God, and shall never see him
again._**


8. The pain of the reprobate shall be increased by the knowledge of the glory which the saints
enjoy in Paradise, and from which they see, and shall for ever see, themselves excluded. How
great would be the pain which a person should feel if, after being invited by his sovereign to
his own theatre, to be present at the singing, dancing, and other amusements, he should be
excluded in punishment of some fault! How bitter should be his anger and disappointment
when, from without, he should hear the shouts of joy and applause within! At present
sinners despise heaven, and lose it for trifles, after Jesus Christ shed the last drop of his blood
to make them worthy of entering into that happy kingdom. But when they shall be confined
in hell, the knowledge of the glory of heaven shall be the greatest of all their torments. St.
John Chrysostom says, **_that to see themselves banished from that land of joy, shall be to the
damned a torment ten thousand times as great as the hell which they suffer. ”Decem mille
quis pœnat gehennas, nihil tale dicet quale est a beata gloria excidere."_** (S. Joan. Chry. ap. 8.
Thorn. Suppl, qu. 98, art. 9.) Oh! that I had at least the hope, the damned will say, that after a
thousand, or even a million of ages, I could recover the divine grace, and become worthy of
entering into heaven, there to see God! But, no! he shall be told, ” **_When the wicked man is_**



**_dead, there shall be no hope any more. ”_** (Prov. xi. 7.) When he was in this life he could have
saved his soul; but because he has died in sin his loss is irreparable. Hence, with tears of
despair, he shall say: "I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living." (Isa. xxxviii. 11.)



9. The thought of having lost God and Paradise, solely through their own fault, shall increase
the torture of the damned. Every damned soul shall say: It was in my power to have led a life
of happiness on earth by loving God, and to have acquired boundless happiness for eternity;
but, in consequence of having loved my vices, I must remain in this place of torments as long
as God shall be God. She will then exclaim in the words of Job: **_"Who will grant me that I
might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me ?"_** (Job
xxxix. 2.) Oh! that I were allowed to go back to the time I lived on earth, when God watched
over me, that I might not fall into this fire! I did not live among the savages, the Indians, or
the Chinese. I was not left without the sacraments, sermons, or masters to instruct me. I was
born in the bosom of the true Church, and have been well instructed and frequently
admonished by preachers and confessors. To this prison I have not been dragged by the
devils; I have come of my own accord. The chains by which I am bound and kept at a
distance from God, I have forged with my own will. How often has God spoken to my heart,
and said to me: **_Amend, and return to me. Beware, lest the time should come when thou shalt
not be able to prevent thy destruction._** Alas! this time has come; the sentence has been
already passed; I am damned; and for my damnation there neither is, nor shall be, any
remedy for all eternity. But if the damned soul has lost God, and shall never see him, perhaps
she can at least love him?! No; she has been abandoned by grace, and thus she is made the
slave of her sins, and compelled to hate him. The damned see that God is their adversary on
account of their contempt for him during life, and are therefore always in despair. ” **_Why hast
thou set me opposite to thee, and I am become burthensome to myself."_** (Job vii. 20.) Hence,
because the damned see that they are enemies of God, whom they at the same time know to
be worthy of infinite love, they are to themselves objects of the greatest horror. The greatest
of all the punishments which God shall inflict on them, will consist in seeing that God is so
amiable, and that they are so deformed, and the enemies of this God. **_“I will set before thy
face."_** (Ps. xlix. 21.)


10. The sight of all that God has done for the damned shall above all increase their torture.
**_"The wicked shall see and shall be angry."_** (Ps. cxi. 10.) They shall see all the benefits which
God bestowed upon them all the lights and calls which he gave them and the patience with
which he waited for them. They shall, above all, see how much Jesus Christ has loved them,
and how much he has suffered for the love of them; and after all his love and all his
sufferings, they shall see that they are now objects of his hatred, and shall be no longer
objects of his love. According to St. Chrysostom, **_a thousand hells are nothing compared with
the thought of being hateful to Christ. ”Si mille quis ponat, gehennas, nihil tale dicturus est,
quale est exosum esse Christo."_** (Hom xiv. in Matt.) Then the damned shall say: **_My
Redeemer, who, through compassion for me, sweated blood, suffered an agony in the garden,
and died on the cross bereft of all consolation, has now no pity on me! I weep, I cry out; but
he no longer hears or looks to me! He is utterly forgetful of me. He once loved me; but now he
hates and justly hates me; for I have ungratefully refused to love him._** David says, that the
reprobate are thrown into the pit of death. **_"Thou shalt bring them down into the pit of
destruction."_** (Ps. liv. 24.) Hence St. Augustine has said: ” **_The pit shall be closed on top, it
shall be opened at the bottom, it shall be expanded downwards; and they who refuse to know_**



**_God shall be no longer known by him."“Puteus claudetur sursum, aperietur deorsum,
dilatatibur in profundum: et ultra nescientur a Deo qui Deum scire noluerunt."_** (Hom, xvi.,
cap 50.)



11. Thus the damned see that God deserves infinite love, and that they cannot love him. St.
Catherine of Genoa being one day assailed by the devil, asked him. who he was. He
answered with tears: **_I am that wicked one who is deprived of the love of God. I am that
miserable being that can never more love God._** They not only cannot love God, but,
abandoned in their sins, they are forced to hate him: their hell consists in hating God, whom
they at the same time know to be infinitely amiable. They love him intensely as their
sovereign good, and hate him as the avenger of their sins. ” **_Res miserrima,"_** says a learned
author, ” **_amare vehementer, et amatum simul odisse."_** (Magnotius Medit.) Their natural love
draws them continually to God; but their hatred drags them away from him. These two
contrary passions, like two ferocious wild beasts, incessantly tear in pieces the hearts of the
damned, and cause, and shall for all eternity cause, them to live in a continual death. The
reprobate then shall hate and curse all the benefits which God has bestowed upon them.
They shall hate the benefits of creation, redemption, and the sacraments. But they shall hate
in a particular manner the sacrament of baptism, by which they have, on account of their
sins, been made more guilty in the sight of God; the sacrament of penance, by which, if they
wished, they could have so easily saved their souls; and, above all, the most holy sacrament
of the altar, in which God had given himself entirely to them. They shall consequently hate
all the other means which have been helps to their salvation. Hence, they shall hate and curse
all the angels and saints. But they shall curse particularly their guardian angels their special
advocates and, above all, the divine mother Mary. They shall curse the three divine persons
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; but particularly Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Word,
who suffered so much, and died for their salvation. They shall curse the wounds of Jesus
Christ, the blood of Jesus Christ, and the death of Jesus Christ. Behold the end to which
accursed sin leads the souls which Jesus Christ has dearly bought.


**SERMON XLIX. TWENTIETH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE
PREDOMINANT PASSION.**
**_"For he was at the point of death. Lord, come down before that my son die." JOHN iv. 47, 49._**


OUR passions are not of themselves bad nor hurtful, when regulated according to the
dictates of reason and prudence, they do us no injury, but are, on the contrary, profitable to
the soul; but, when disorderly, they are productive of irreparable mischief to those who obey
them; for, when any passion takes possession of the heart, it obscures the truth, and makes
the soul incapable of distinguishing between good and evil. Ecclesiasticus implored the Lord
to deliver him from a mind under the sway of passion. **_"Give me not over to a shameless and
foolish mind."_** (Eccl. xxiii. 6.) Let us, then, be careful not to allow any bad passion to rule over
us. In this day’s gospel it is related that a certain ruler, whose son was at the point of death
(incipiebat enim mori), knowing that Jesus Christ had come into Galilee, went in search of
him, and entreated him to come and cure his son. **_"Come down before that my son die."_** The
same may be said of him who begins to submit to the tyranny of any passion. ” **_He is at the
point of death”_** of the soul, which should be dreaded far more than the death of the body.
Hence, if he wishes to preserve spiritual life, he ought to ask the Lord to deliver him as soon
as possible from that passion Lord, come down before my soul die; if he do not, he shall be



miserably lost. I intend Today to show the great danger of damnation to which all who
submit to the domination of any bad passions are exposed.


1. ” **_Only this,"_** said Solomon, ” **_I found, that God made man right, and he hath entangled
himself with an infinity of questions."_** (Eccl. vii. 30.)” **_God created man right"_** that is, in the
state of justice; but, by giving ear to the serpent, man exposed himself to temptations, and
was conquered. He rebelled against God, and his passions rebelled against himself. These are
the passions which, according to St. Paul, cause a continual war between the flesh and the
spirit. ” **_For the flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."_** (Gal. v. 17.)
However, with the aid of divine grace, it is in man’s power to resist these passions, and not to
allow them to rule over him. It is, as the Lord told Cain, even in the power of man to rule
over them, and to bring them into subjection to reason. ” **_But the lust thereof shall be under
thee, and thou shalt have dominion over it."_** (Gen. iv. 7.) Let the assaults of the flesh and of
the devil, to make us abandon the way of God, be ever so violent, Jesus Christ has said: ” **_Lo!
the kingdom of God is within you."_** (Luke xvii. 21.) Within us he has established a kingdom,
in which the will is the queen that ought to rule over all the senses and passions. And what
greater honour or glory can a man have, than to be the master of his passions?



2. The proper regulation of the motions of the mind constitutes the interior mortification so
much recommended by spiritual masters, and secures the salvation of the soul. The health of
the body depends on the regulation of the humours: if one of them predominate to excess it
causes death. But the health of the soul consists in the proper control of the passions by
reason. But, when any passion rules over reason, it first enslaves, and then kills the soul.


3. Many pay great attention to their external conduct; they endeavour to appear modest and
respectful; but, at the same time, they cherish in their hearts sinful affections against justice,
charity, humility, and chastity. For them is prepared the chastisement with which the Saviour
threatened the Scribes and Pharisees, who were careful to have their cups and dishes clean,
but nourished within unjust and unclean thoughts. ” **_Woe to you, Scribes and Pharisees
hypocrites; because you make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish; but, within you are
full of rapine and uncleanness."_** (Matt, xxiii. 25.) The Royal Prophet says, that all the beauty
of a soul that is the true daughter of God consists in an interior good will. **_"All the glory of
the king‟s daughter is within."_** (Ps. xliv. 14.) **_Of what use, then,_** says St. Jerome, **_is it to
abstain from food, and at the same time to allow the mind to swell with pride? or to abstain
from wine, and to indulge in the drunkenness of anger?”Quid prodest tenuari abstinentia, si
animus superbia intumescit? quid vinum non bibere, et odio inebriari ?"_** Christians who act
in this manner do not lay aside their vices; they only cover them with the mantle of devotion.
A man, then, must divest himself of all bad passions; otherwise he will not be the king, but
the slave of his affections, and in opposition to the command of the Apostle sin shall reign in
his heart. **_"Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, so as to obey the lusts thereof."_**
(Rom. vi. 12.) **_Man, then, is,_** as St. Thomas says, **_the king of himself when he regulates his
body and his carnal affections according to reason. ”Rex est homo per rationem, quia per
cam regit totum corpus et affectus ejus."_** (In Joan, iv.) But, according to St. Jerome, ” **_when the
soul serves vice she loses the honour of a kingdom."_** (In Thren., ii. 7.) She loses the honour of
a queen, and becomes, as St. John teaches, the slave of sin. ” **_Whosoever committeth sin is the
servant of sin."_** (John viii. 34.)





4. St. James exhorts us to treat the body and its lusts as we would treat a horse. "We put a
bridle in the mouth of a horse, and we bring him wherever we please. “ **_We put bits in the
mouths of horses, that they may obey us, and we turn about their whole body."_** (St. James iii.
3.) Hence, as soon as we feel the cravings of any bad passion, we must restrain it with the
bridle of reason; for, if we yield to its demands, it will bring us to the level of brute animals,
that obey not the dictates of reason, but the impulse of their beastly appetites. ” **_And man,
when he was in honour, did not understand: he is compared to senseless beasts, and is
become like to them."_** (Ps. xlviii. 13.)” **_It is worse,"_** says St, John Chrysostom, **_"to become like,
than to be born, a senseless beast; for, to be naturally without reason is tolerable."_** The saint
says, that to want reason by nature is not disgraceful; but, to be born with the gift of reason,
and afterwards to live like a beast, obeying the lusts of the flesh, is degrading to man, and
makes him worse than a senseless brute. What would you say if you saw a man who would,
of his own accord, live in a stable with horses, feed with them on hay and oats, and sleep, as
they do, on dung? The man who submits to the tyranny of any passion, does what is far
worse in the eyes of God.


5. It was thus the Gentiles lived, who, because the darkness of their understanding prevented
them from discerning between good and evil, went wherever their sensual appetite led them.
” **_That you walk not,"_** says St. Paul, ” **_as also the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,
having their understanding darkened."_** (Ephes. iv. 17, 18.) Hence they were abandoned to
their vices to impurity and avarice, and blindly obeyed the commands of their passions.
” **_Who, despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all
uncleanness, unto covetousness."_** (verse 19.) To this miserable state are reduced all Christians
who, despising reason and God, follow the dictates of passion. In punishment of their sins
God abandons them, as he abandoned the Gentiles, to their own wicked desires. ”Wherefore
God gave them up to the desires of their own heart." (Rom. i. 24.) This is the greatest of all
chastisements.


6. St. Augustine writes, that **_two cities may be built up in the heart of a Christian; one by the
love of God, the other by self-love. ”Cœlestem (civitatem) ædificat amor Dei usque ad
contemptum sui; terrestrem ædificat amor sui usque ad contemptum Dei."_** (Lib. li, de Civ.,
cap. xxviii.) Thus, if the love of God reign within us, we will despise ourselves: if self-love
reign, we will despise God. But, in conquering self-love consists the victory to which shall be
given a crown of eternal glory. This was the great maxim which St. Francis Xavier always
inculcated to his disciples: ” **_Conquer yourself; conquer yourself."_** All the thoughts and
feelings of man, says the Scripture, are inclined to evil from his boyhood. ” **_The imagination
and thought of man‟s heart are prone to evil from his youth."_** (Gen. viii. 21.) Hence we must,
during our whole life, zealously combat and conquer the evil inclinations which continually
rise within us, as noxious weeds spring up in our gardens. Some will ask how they can free
themselves from bad passions, and how they can prevent them from starting up within them.
St. Gregory gives the answer: ” **_It is one thing to look at these heasts, and another to keep
them within the den of the heart."_** (Mor. lib. 6, cap. xvi.) It is one thing, says the saint, to look
at these beasts, or bad passions, when they are outside, and another to harbour them in the
heart. As long as they are outside they can do us no harm; but if we admit them into the soul
they devour us.





7. All bad passions spring from self-love. This is, as Jesus Christ teaches all who wish to
follow him, the principal enemy which we have to contend with; and this enemy we must
conquer by self-denial. ” **_If anyone shall come after me let him deny himself."_** (Matt. xvi.
24.)” **_Non intrat in te, amor Dei,"_** says Thomas a Kempis, ” **_nisi exulet amor tui."_** Unless we
banish self- love from the heart the love of God cannot enter. Blessed Angela of Foligno used
to say, that she was more afraid of self-love than of the devil, because self-love has greater
power than the devil to draw us into sin. St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi used to say the same,
as we read in her life: ” **_Self-love is the greatest traitor we have to guard against. Like Judas,
it betrays us with a kiss. He who conquers it conquers all enemies; he who dees not conquer
it is lost."_** The saint then adds: ” **_If you cannot kill it with a single stroke give it poison."_** She
meant, that since we are not able to destroy this accursed enemy, which, according to St.
Francis de Sales, dies only with our latest breath, we must at least labour to weaken it as
much as possible; for when strong it kills us. **_Death,_** says St. Basil, **_is the reward which self-
love gives its followers. The wages of self-love is death; it is the beginning of every evil.
”Stipendium amoris proprii mors est, initium omnis mali."_** (S. Bas. Apud Lyreum, lib. 2.)
Self-love seeks not what is just and honourable, but what is agreeable to the senses. Hence
Jesus Christ has said: ” **_He that loveth his life"_** that is, his sensual appetite or self-will” **_shall
lose it."_** (John xii. 25.) He who truly loves himself, and wishes to save his soul, should refuse
to the senses whatever God has forbidden; otherwise he shall lose God and himself.


8. There are two passions which reign within us: the concupiscible and irascible appetites that
is, love and hatred. I have said, **_two principal passions;_** for each of them, when vicious,
draws in its train many other bad passions. The concupiscible appetite brings with it
temerity, ambition, greediness, avarice, jealousy, scandal. The irascible brings with it
revenge, injustice, slander, envy. St. Augustine **_advises us, in our combat with the passions,
not to endeavour to beat them all down in a single conflict. ”Calca jacentem, conflige cum
resistente."_** (In cap. viii. Rom.) We must trample on the passion which we have cast to the
ground, so that it may be no longer able to contend with us, and then we must endeavour to
subdue the other passions which resist our efforts.


9. But we must endeavour above all to find out our predominant passion. He who conquers
this conquers all his passions; he who allows himself to be overcome by it is lost. God
commanded Saul to destroy all the Amalecites, along with all their animals and all their
property. He destroyed everything that was vile, but spared the life of King Agag, and
preserved all that was valuable and beautiful. ” **_And Saul and the people spared Agag and the
rest of the flocks of sheep .... and all that was beautiful, and would not destroy them; but
everything that was vile and good for nothing, that they destroyed."_** (1 Kings xv. 9.) In this
Saul was afterwards imitated by the Scribes and Pharisees, to whom our Lord said: ” **_Woe to
you, Scribes and Pharisees, because you tithe mint, and anise, and cummin, and have left the
weightier things of the law, judgment, and mercy, and faith."_** (Matt, xxiii. 23.) They were
careful to pay the tithe of things of least value, and neglected the more important things of
the law: such as justice, charity to their neighbour, and faith in God. Some persons act in a
similar manner; they abstain from certain defects of minor importance, and, at the same time,
allow themselves to be ruled by their predominant passions; but if they do not destroy this
passion, they never shall gain the victory of salvation.





The King of Syria commanded the captains of his cavalry to kill the King of Israel only, and
not to mind the others. ” **_Fight ye not with small or great, but with the King of Israel only."_** (2
Paral. xviii. 30.) They obeyed the order, slew King Achab, and gained the victory.



10. We must imitate the captains of Syria: unless we kill the king that is, the predominant
passion we shall never be able to obtain salvation. The passion which brings man under its
sway, first blinds him and prevents him from seeing his danger. Now, how can a blind man,
led by a blind guide, such as passion, which follows not reason, but sensual pleasures,
possibly avoid falling into some abyss?” **_If the blind lead the blind, both fall into the pit."_**
(Matt. xv. 14.) St. Gregory says **_that it is a common artifice of the devil to inflame daily more
and more our predominant passion, and thus he brings us into many horrible excesses._**
Through passion for a kingdom, Herod spilled the blood of so many innocent infants.
Through love for a woman, Henry the Eighth was the cause of so many frightful spiritual
evils, put to death several most worthy individuals, and, in the end, lost the faith. No
wonder: for he who is under the domination of any passion no longer sees what he does.
Therefore he disregards corrections, excommunications, and even his own damnation: he
seeks only his own pleasures, and says: ” **_Come what will, I must satisfy this passion. And,
as eminent virtue is accompanied by other virtues, so an enormous vice brings in its train
other vices. ”In catena iniquitatis,"_** says St. Lawrence Justinian, ” **_foederata sunt vitia."_**


11. It is necessary, then, as soon as we perceive any passion beginning to reign within us, to
beat it down instantly, before it acquires strength. ” **_Let cupidity gain strength,"_** says St.
Augustine, ” **_strike it down while it is small."_** (In Ps. cxxxvi.) St. Ephrem gives the same
advice: ” **_Unless you quickly destroy passions, they cause an ulcer."_** (De Perfect.) A wound, if
it be not closed up, will soon become an incurable ulcer. To illustrate this by an example, a
certain monk, as St. Dorotheus relates (Serm. xi.), commanded one of his disciples to pluck
up a small cypress. The disciple obeyed, and drew it up with a slight effort. The monk then
ordered him to pull up another tree, which was somewhat larger. He succeeded in the task;
but not without a good deal of labour. The disciple was then told to pluck up a tree which
had taken deep root; but all his efforts were ineffectual. The monk then said to him: Thus it is,
my son, with our passions; when they have taken deep root in the heart, we shall not be able
to extirpate them. **_Dearly beloved brethren, keep always before your eyes this maxim: that
either the spirit must trample on the flesh, or the flesh shall trample on the spirit._**


12. Cassian has laid down an excellent rule for conquering our passions. Let us endeavour, he
says, to change the object of our passions; and thus from being vicious they shall become
holy. Some are prone to anger against all who treat them with disrespect. Such persons ought
to change the object of their passions, and turn their indignation into a hatred of sin, which is
more injurious to them than all the devils in hell. Others are inclined to love every one who
possesses amiable qualities: they should fix all their affections on God, who is infinitely
amiable. But, to recommend ourselves to God, and to beg of him to deliver us from our
passions, is the best remedy against them. And, when any passion becomes very violent, we
must multiply prayers. Reasoning and reflections are then of little use; for passion obscures
our faculties; and the more we reflect the more delightful the object of passion appears.
Hence, there is no other remedy than to have recourse to Jesus and to most holy Mary, saying
with tears and sighs: ” **_Lord, save us, or we perish: do not permit us to be ever separated from
thee. "We fly to thy protection, holy mother of God."_** O souls created to love God, let us raise



ourselves above the earth; let us cease to fix our thoughts and affections on the miserable
things of this world; let us cease to love dross and smoke and dung; let us endeavour with all
our strength to love the Supreme Infinite Good, our most amiable God, who has made us for
himself, and expects us in heaven to make us happy, and to make us enjoy the very glory
which he enjoys for eternity.


**SERMON L. TWENTY-FIRST SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON THE ETERNITY OF
HELL.**
**_" And his Lord, being angry, delivered him to the torture until he paid all the debt." MATT,
xviii. 34._**


IN this day’s gospel we find that a certain servant, having badly administered the affairs of
his master, was found to owe him a debt of ten thousand talents. The master demanded
payment; but the servant falling down said: ” **_Have patience and I will pay thee all."_** The
master took pity on him, and forgave the entire debt. One of his fellow-servants who owed
him a hundred pence, besought him to have patience, and promised to pay him the last
farthing; but the wicked servant cast him into prison. Hearing of this act of cruelty to his
fellow-servant, the master sent for him, and said to him: "Wicked servant, I have forgiven
thee ten thousand talents, and for a debt of a hundred pence thou hast refused to show
compassion to thy fellow-servant. He then delivered him to the tortures till he paid all the
debt. Behold, dearly beloved brethren, in these last words, a description of the sentence of the
eternal death which is prepared for sinners. By dying in sin, they die debtors to God for all
their iniquities; and being unable to make any satisfaction in the other life for their past sins,
they remain for ever debtors to the divine justice, and must suffer for eternity in hell. Of this
miserable eternity I will speak to-day: listen to me with attention.



1. The thought of eternity is a **_great thought:_** so it was called by St. Augustine: **_Magna
cogitatio._** According to the holy doctor, God has made us Christians, and instructed us in the
maxims of faith, that we may think of eternity. ” **_We are Christians that we may always think
of the world to come."_** This thought has driven from the world so many of the nobles of the
earth, has made them renounce all their riches, and shut themselves up in the cloister, there
to live in poverty and penance. This thought has sent so many young men into caves and
deserts, and has animated so many martyrs to embrace torments and death, in order to save
their souls for eternity. ” **_For,"_** exclaims St. Paul, ” **_we have not here a lasting city, but we seek
one that is to come."_** (Heb. xiii. 14.) This earth, dearly beloved Christians, is not our country;
it is for us a place of passage, through which we must soon pass to the house of eternity.
” **_Man shall go into the house of his eternity."_** (Eccl. xii. 5.) In this eternity the house of the
just, which is a palace of delights, is very different from the house of sinners, which is a
dungeon of torments. Into one of these two houses each of us must certainly go. ” **_In hanc vel
illam æternitatem,"_** says St. Ambrose, ” **_cadam necesse est.;_** (S. Amb., in Ps. cxviii.)” **_Into this
or that eternity I must fall."_**


2. And where the soul shall first go, there she shall remain for ever. ” **_If the tree fall to the
south or to the north, in what place soever it shall fall there shall it lie."_** (Eccl. xi. 3.) On
what side does a tree fall when it is cut down? It falls on the side to which it inclines. On
what side, brethren, will you fall, when death shall cut down the tree of your life? You will
fall on the side to which you incline. If you shall be found inclining to the south that is, in



favour with God you shall be for ever happy; but if you will fall to the north, you must be for
ever miserable. There is no middle place: you must be for ever happy in heaven, or
overwhelmed with despair in hell. **_We must all die,_** says St. Bernard or some other author (de
Quat. Noviss.), **_but we know not which of the two eternities shall be our lot after death.
”Necessi morem, post hæc autem dubia ceternitatis."_**



3. This uncertainty about his lot for eternity was the constant subject of the thoughts of
David: it deprived his eyes of sleep, and kept him always in terror. ” **_My eyes prevented the
watches: I was troubled, and I spoke not: I thought upon the days of old, and I had in my
mind the eternal years."_** (Ps. Ixxvi. 5, 6.) **_What,_** says St. Cyprian, **_has encouraged the saints to
lead a life, which, on account of their continual austerities, was an uninterrupted
martyrdom? It was,_** he answers, **_the thought of eternity that inspired them with courage to
submit to such unceasing rigours._** A certain monk shut himself in a cave, and did nothing else
than constantly exclaim: ” **_eternity! eternity!"_** The famous sinner converted hy the Abbot
Paphnutius, kept eternity always before her eyes, and was accustomed to say: ”Who can
assure me of a happy eternity, and that I will not fall into a miserable eternity." The same
uncertainty kept St. Andrew Avellino in continual terrors and tears till his last breath. Hence
he used to ask every one he met, ” **_What do you say? shall I be saved or damned for eternity
?"_**


4. 0! that we, too, had eternity always before our eyes! We certainly should not be so much
attached to the world. ” **_Quisquis in æternitatis disiderio figitur, nee prosperitate attollitur,
nee adversitate quassatur: et dum nihil habet in mundo quod appetat, nihil est quod de
mundo pertimescat."_** He who fixes his thoughts on eternity, is not elated by prosperity nor
dejected by adversity; because, having nothing to desire in this world, he has nothing to fear:
he desires only a happy eternity, and fears only a miserable eternity. A certain lady, who was
greatly attached to the world, went one day to confession to Father M. D Avila. He bid her go
home, and reflect on these two words always and never. She obeyed, took away her
affections from the world, and consecrated them to God. St. Augustine says that **_the man who
thinks on eternity, and is not converted to God, either has no faith, or has lot his reason. “O
æternitas! qui te cogitat, nec pœnitet, aut certo fidem non habet, aut si habet, cor non habet."_**
(In soliloq.) O **_eternity! he who thinks on thee, and does not repent, has certainly no faith, or
has lost his heart._** Hence St. Chrysostom relates, **_that the pagans upbraided the Christians
with being liars or fools: liars, if they said they believed what they did not believe; fools, if
they believed in eternity and committed sin. ”Exprobabant gentiles aut mendaces, aut stultos
esse Christianos; mendaces si non crederent quod credere dicebant; stultos si credebant et
peccabant."_**


5. **Woe to sinners,** says St. Cesarius of Arles; **_they enter into eternity without having known
it; but their woes shall be doubled when they shall have entered into eternity, and shall never
be able to leave. ”Væ peccatoribus, ineognitam ingrediuntur."_** To those who enter hell, the
door opens for their admission, but never opens for their departure. ”I have the keys of death
and of hell." (Apoc. i. 18.) God himself keeps the keys of hell, to show us that whosoever
enters has no hope of ever escaping from it. St. John Chrysostom writes, **_that the
condemnation of the reprobate is engraved on the pillar of eternity, so that it never shall be
revoked._** In hell there is no calendar; there the years are not counted. St. Antonine says, **_that if
a damned soul heard that she was to be released from hell after so many millions of years as_**



**_there are drops of water in the sea, or grains of sand in the earth, she would feel a greater joy
than a criminal condemned to death would experience at hearing that he was reprieved, and
was to be made the monarch of the whole world!_** But, no! as many millions of years shall
pass away as there are drops of water in the ocean, or grains of dust in the earth, and the hell
of the damned shall be at its commencement. All these millions of years shall be multiplied
an infinite number of times, and hell will begin again. **_But of what use is it,_** says St. Hilary, **_to
count years in eternity? Where you expect the end, there it commences. ”Ubi putas finem
invenire, ibi incipit."_** And St. Augustine says, ” **_that things which have an end cannot be
compared with eternity."_** (In Ps. xxxvi.) Each of the damned would be content to make this
compact with God - **_Lord, increase my torments as much as thou pleasest; assign a term for
them as distant as thou pleasest; provided thou fix a time at which they shall cease, I am
satisfied._** But, no! this time shall never arrive. **_“My end,"_** the damned shall say, ” **_is perished."_**
(Lamen. iii. 18.) Then, is there no end to the torments of the damned? No! the trumpet of
divine justice sounds in the caverns of hell, and continually reminds the reprobate that their
hell shall be eternal, and shall never have an end.



6. If hell were not eternal, it would not be so frightful a chastisement. Thomas a Kempis says,
that “ **_everything which passes with time is trifling and short."_** Any pain which has an end is
not very appalling. The man who labours under an imposthume or a cancer, must submit to
the knife or the cautery: the pain is severe; but because it is soon over it can be borne. But a
tooth-ache which lasts for three months without interruption is insupportable. Were a person
obliged to lie in the same posture for six months on a soft bed, or even to hear the same
music, or the same comedy, night and day for one year, he would fall into melancholy and
despondency. Poor blind sinners! When threatened with hell they say: ” **_If I go there I must
have patience."_** But they shall not say so when they will have entered that region of woes,
where they must suffer, not by listening to the same music or the same comedy, nor by lying
in the same posture, or by tooth -ache, but by enduring all torments and all evils. ” **_I will heap
evils upon them."_** (Deut. xxxiii. 23.) And all these torments shall never end.


7. They shall never end, and shall never be diminished in the smallest degree. The damned
must for ever suffer the same fire, the same privation of God, the same sadness, the same
despair. **_Yes,_** says St. Cyprian, **_in eternity there is no change, because the decree is immutable._**
This thought shall immensely increase their sufferings, by making them feel beforehand, and
at each moment, all that they shall have to suffer for eternity. In this description of the
happiness of the saints, and the misery of the reprobate, the Prophet Daniel says: ” **_They shall
wake some unto life everlasting, and some unto reproach to see it always."_** (Dan. xii. 2.) They
shall always see their **_unhappy eternity. Ut videant semper._** Thus eternity tortures each of the
damned not only by his present pains, but with all his future sufferings, which are eternal.


8. These are not opinions controverted among theologians; they are dogmas of faith clearly
revealed in the sacred Scriptures. ” **_Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire."_** (Matt.
xxv. 41.) Some will say: **_The fire, but not the punishment of the damned is everlasting._** Such
the language of the incredulous, but it is folly. For what other purpose would God make this
fire eternal, than to chastise the reprobate, who are immortal? But, to take away every
shadow of doubt, the Scriptures, in many other places, say, that not only the fire, but the
punishment, of the damned is eternal. ” **_And these, ”says Jesus Christ, "shall go into ever
lasting punishment."_** (Matt. xxv. 46.) Again we read in St. Mark, ” **_Where the worm dieth not,_**



**_and the fire is not extinguished."_** (ix. 43.) St. John says: ” **_And the smoke of their torments
shall ascend up for ever and ever."_** (Apoc. xvi. 11.) **_"Who,"_** says St. Paul, ” **_shall suffer eternal
punishment in destruction."_** (2 Thess. i. 9.)



9. Another infidel will ask: **_How can God justly punish with eternal torments a sin that lasts
but a moment?_** I answer, that the grievousness of a crime is measured not by its duration, but
by the enormity of its malice. **_The malice of mortal sin is, as St. Thomas says, infinite._** (1, 2, q.
87, art. 4.) Hence, the damned deserve infinite punishment; and, because a creature is not
capable of suffering pains infinite in point of intensity, God, as the holy doctor says, renders
the punishment of the damned infinite in extension by making it eternal. Moreover, it is just,
that as long as the sinner remains in his sin, the punishment which he deserves should
continue. And, therefore, as the virtue of the saints is rewarded in Heaven, because it lasts for
ever, so also the guilt of the damned in Hell, because it is everlasting, shall be chastised with
everlasting torments. ” **_Quia non recipit causæ remedium,"_** says Eusebius Emissenus, **_"carebit
fine supplicium." The cause of their perverse will continues: therefore, their chastisement
will never have an end._** The damned are so obstinate in their sins, that even if God offered
pardon, their hatred for him would make them refuse it. The Prophet Jeremias, speaking in
the name of the reprobate, says: **_“Why is my sorrow become perpetual and my wound
desperate, so as to refuse to be healed?"_** (Jer. xv. 18.) My wound, they say, is incurable,
because I do not wish it to be healed. Now, how can God heal the wound of their perverse
will, when they would refuse the remedy, were it offered to them? Hence, the punishment of
the reprobate is called a sword, a vengeance which is irrevocable. ” **_I, the Lord, have drawn
my sword out of its sheath, not to be turned back."_** (Ezech. xxi. 5.)


10. Death, which is so terrible in this life, is desired in hell by the damned; but they never
shall find it. ” **_And in these days men shall seek death, and shall not find it: and they shall
desire to die, and death shall fly from them."_** (Apoc. xi. 6.) They would wish, as a remedy for
their eternal ruin, to be exterminated and destroyed. But” **_there is no poison of destruction in
them."_** (Wis. i. 14.) If a man, condemned to die, be not deprived of life by the first stroke of
the axe, his torture moves the people to pity. Miserable damned souls! They live in continual
death in the midst of the pains of hell: death excites in them all the agony of death, but does
not give them a remedy by taking away life. “ **_Prima mors,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_animam
nolentem pellit de corpore, secunda mors nolentem tenet in corpore. ”_** The first death expels
from the body the soul of a sinner who is unwilling to die: but the second death that is,
eternal death retains in the body a soul that wishes to die. ” **_They are laid in hell like sheep;
death shall feed upon them."_** (Ps. xlviii. 15.) In feeding, sheep eat the blades of grass, but
leave the root untouched; hence the grass dies not, but grows up again. It is thus that death
treats the damned; it torments them with pain, but spares their life, which may be called the
root of suffering.


11. But, if these miserable souls have no chance of release from hell, perhaps they can at least
deceive or flatter themselves with the hope, that God may one day be moved to pity, and free
them from their torments? No: in hell there is no delusion, no flattery, no perhaps; the
damned are as certain as they are of God’s existence that their hell shall have no end. ” **_Thou
thoughtest unjustly that I shall be like to thee; but I will reprove thee, and set before thy
face."_** (Ps. xlix. 21.) They shall for ever see before their eyes their sins and the sentence of their
eternal condemnation. ” **_And I will set before thy face."_**



### 


12. Let us conclude. Thus, most beloved brethren, the affair of our eternal salvation should be
the sole object of all our concerns. ” **_The business for which we struggle, ”_** says St. Eucharius,
” **_is eternity."_** There is question of eternity: there is question whether we will be saved, and be
for ever happy in a city of delights, or be damned, and confined for eternity in a pit of fire.
This is not an affair of little importance; it is of the utmost and of eternal importance to us.
When Thomas More was condemned to death by Henry the Eighth, his wife Louisa went to
him for the purpose of tempting him to obey the royal command. Tell me, Lousia, replied the
holy man, how many years can I, who am now so old, expect to live? You might, said she,
live for twenty years. O foolish woman! he exclaimed, do you want me to condemn my soul
to an eternity of torments for twenty years of life?


13. O God! Christians believe in the existence of hell, and commit sin! Dearly beloved
brethren, let not us also be fools, like so many who are now weeping in hell. Miserable
beings! What benefit do they now derive from all the pleasures which they enjoyed in this
life? Speaking of the rich and of the poor, St. John Chrysostom said: ” **_unhappy felicity, which
has drawn the rich into eternal infelicity! O happy infelicity, which has brought the poor to
the felicity of eternity!”_** The saints have buried themselves alive in this life, that after death
they may not find themselves buried in hell for all eternity. If eternity were a doubtful matter,
we ought even then make every effort in our power to escape an eternity of torments; but no,
it is not a matter of doubt; it is a truth of faith, that after this life each of us must go into
eternity, to be for ever in glory or for ever in despair. St. Teresa says, **_that it is through a
want of faith that so many Christians are lost._** As often as we say the words of the Creed,
life everlasting, let us enliven our faith, and remember that there is another life, which never
ends; and let us adopt all the means necessary to secure a happy eternity. Let us do all, and
give up all; if necessary, let us leave the world, in order to secure eternal happiness. **_When
eternity is at stake no security can be too great. ”Nulla nimia securitas,"_** says St. Bernard,
” **_ubi periclitatur æternitas."_**


**SERMON LI. TWENTY-SECOND SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - STRAITS AND
ANGUISH OF DYING CHRISTIANS WHO HAVE BEEN NEGLIGENT DURING LIFE
ABOUT THE DUTIES OF RELIGION.**
**_"Render, therefore, to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar‟s, and to God the things that are
God‟s." MATT. xxii. 21._**


ONE day, the Pharisees, with the malignant intention of ensnaring him in his speech, that
they might afterwards accuse him before the ministers of Caesar, sent their disciples to ask
Jesus Christ, if it were lawful to pay tribute to Caesar. In answer, the Redeemer, after looking
at the coin of the tribute, asked: ” **_Whose image and inscription is this ?"_** Being told it was
Cæsar’s, he said: ” **_Render then to Cæsar the things that are Cæsar‟s, and to God the things
that are God‟s."_** By these words Jesus Christ wishes to teach us, that it is our duty to give to
men what is due to them; and to reserve for him all the affections of our heart, since he
created us to love him, and afterwards imposed upon us a precept of loving him. ” **_Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart."_** Miserable the man who, at the hour of death,
shall see that he has loved creatures, that he has loved his pleasures, and has not loved God.
**_"When distress cometh upon them, they will seek peace, and there will be none."_** (Ezech. yii.
25.) He will then seek peace, but shall not find it; for many causes of distress and trouble shall



assail him. What shall these causes be? Behold, the unhappy man shall then say, **_first: God! I
could have become a saint, but have not become one. Secondly, he shall say: Oh! that I now
had time to repair the evil I have done! but time is at an end. Thirdly: Oh! that at least, in
the short time which remains, I could remedy the past: but, alas! this time is not fit for
repairing past evils._**


**_First Point. God! I could have, but have not, become a saint._**



1. Because, during their whole life, they thought only of pleasing God and sanctifying
themselves, the saints go with great confidence to meet death, which delivers them from the
miseries and dangers of the present life, and unites them perfectly with God. But the man
who has thought only of his pleasures and of his own ease, and has neglected to recommend
himself to God, or to reflect on the account which he must one day render, cannot meet death
with confidence. Poor sinners! they banish the thought of death whenever it presents itself to
them, and think only of living in pleasures and amusements, as if they never were to die. But
for each of them the end must one day come. **_"The end is come; the end is come."_** (Ezech. vii,
2.) And when this end is come every one must gather the fruit which he has sown during his
life. **_"For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap."_** (Gal. vi. 8.) If he has sown
works of holiness, he shall receive rewards of eternal life; but if he has sown evil works, he
shall reap chastisements and eternal death.


2. The scene of his past life is the first thing which shall rush on the mind of the dying man,
when the news of death shall be announced to him. He shall then see things in a light far
different from that in which he viewed them during life. The acts of revenge which appeared
to him lawful the scandals which he disregarded the liberty of speaking obscenely and
injurious to the character of his neighbour the pleasures which were regarded as innocent the
acts of injustice which he held to be allowable shall then appear what they really were:
grevious sins and offences against God, each of which merited hell. Alas! those blind sinners,
who voluntarily blind themselves during life, by shutting their eyes to the light shall, at
death, involuntarily see all the evil they have done. ” **_Then shall the eyes of the blind be
opened."_** (Is. xxxv. 5.) At the light of the candle which lights him to death, ” **_the wicked shall
see and shall be angry,"_** (Ps. cxi. 10.) He shall see all the irregularities of his past life his
frequent abuse of the sacraments, confessions made without sorrow or purpose of
amendment, contracts completed with remorse of conscience, injury done to the property
and reputation of others, immodest jests, rancours, and vindictive thoughts. He shall then see
the bad examples which he gave to young persons who feared God, and whom he treated
with contempt, and turned into derision by calling them hypocrites and other reproachful
names. He shall see so many lights and calls received from God, so many admonitions of
spiritual fathers, and so many resolutions and promises made but afterwards neglected.


3. He shall see particularly the bad maxims by which he regulated his conduct during life. ” **_It
is necessary to seek the esteem of the world, and to preserve honour."_** But is it necessary for a
man to preserve his honour by trampling on the honour due to God? **_"We ought to indulge in
amusements as often as we can."_** But is it lawful to indulge in amusements by insulting
God?” **_Of what use to the world is the man who lives in poverty and has no money?”_** But,
will you, for the sake of money, lose your soul? In answer to these questions the sinner says:
No matter. What can be done?” **_If we do not make a fortune in the world we cannot appear_**



**_among our equals."_** Such the maxims of the worldling during life; but at death he shall
change his language. He shall then see the truth of that maxim of Jesus Christ: ” **_"What doth
it profit a man, if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul."_** (Matt. xvi.
26 .) **_Unhappy me! the worldling shall exclaim on the bed of death, I have had so much time
to tranquillize my conscience, and behold I am now at the point of death, and I find my soul
burdened with so many sins? What would it have cost me to have broken oft such a
friendship, to have gone to confession every week, to have avoided certain occasions of sin?
Ah! very little, but though it should have cost me a great deal of pain and labour, I ought to
have submitted to every inconvenience in order to save my soul. Salvation is of greater
importance to me than the dominion of the entire world._** But, alas! the sentiments of
negligent Christians at death are as fruitless as the sorrows of the damned, who mourn in hell
over their sins as the cause of their perdition, but mourn in vain.



4. At that time they derive no consolation from their past amusements or pomps, from their
exalted dignities, or from the humiliation of their rivals. On the contrary, at the hour of death,
these things, like so many swords shall pierce their hearts. **_"Evil shall catch the unjust man
unto destruction."_** (Ps. cxxxix, 12.) At present the lovers of the world seek after banquets,
dances, games, and scenes of laughter and joy; but, at the time of death this laughter and joy,
as St. James says, shall be turned into mourning and affliction. **_"Let your laughter be turned
into mourning, and your joy into sorrow."_** (St. James iv. 5.) Of this we see frequent examples.
A young man who entertains his companions by sallies of wit and by immodest jests, is
seized with a severe illness. His friends come to see him, and find him. overwhelmed with
grief and melancholy. He indulges no more in jests, or laughter, or conversation. If he speaks
at all, his words are words of terror or despair. His friends ask why he speaks so
despondingly why he is so melancholy. Have courage, they say: your illness is not
dangerous. They endeavour to inspire hope and cheerfulness: but he is silent. And how can
he be cheerful when he feels his conscience burdened with many sins, sees that he must soon
appear before Jesus Christ to give an account of his entire life, and that he has much reason to
fear that he shall receive the sentence of eternal death? He will then say: O fool that I have
been! Oh! that I had loved God! Had I loved him, I should not now find myself in these
straits, in, this anguish. Oh! that I had time to tranquillize the troubles of my conscience? Let
us pass to the second point.


**_Second Point. Oh! that I had time to repair the evil I have done! but now time is at an end._**


5. **_Oh! that I had time, he will say, to repair the past!_** But, when will he say this? When the
oil in the lamp is consumed: when he is on the point of entering into eternity. One of the
greatest causes of the distress and anguish of the careless Christian at the hour of death, is the
remembrance of the bad use he has made of the time in which he ought to have acquired
merits for heaven, and in which he has accumulated merits for hell. **_Oh! that I had time! Do
you seek for time? You have lost so many nights in gaming, and so many years in indulging
the senses, without ever thinking of your soul; and now you seek for time; but time is now no
more. ”Time shall be no longer."_** (Apoc. x. 6.) Were you not already admonished by preachers
to be prepared for death? were you not told that it would come upon you when you least
expected it? **_"Be you ready,"_** says Jesus Christ;” **_for at what hour you think not the Son of
Man will come."_** (Luke xii. 40.) You have despised my admonitions, and have voluntarily
squandered the time which my goodness bestowed upon you in spite of your demerits; but



now time is at an end. Listen to the words in which the priest that assists you shall tell you to
depart from this world: **_Proficisere anima Christiana de hoc mundo. Go forth, Christian soul,
from this world._** And where shall you go? To eternity, to eternity. Death respects neither
parents nor monarchs; when it comes, it does not wait even for a moment. ” **_Thou hast
appointed his bounds, which cannot be passed."_** (Job xiv. 5.)



6. Oh! what terror shall the dying man feel at hearing the assisting priest tell him to depart
from this world! what dismay shall he experience in saying with himself: **_"This morning I am
living, and this evening I shall be dead!”Today I am in this house; tomorrow I shall be in the
grave: and where shall my soul be found?_** His terror shall be increased when he sees the
death-candle lighted, and when he hears the confessor order the relatives to withdraw from
his chamber, and to return to it no more. It shall be still more increased when the confessor
gives him the crucifix, and tells him to embrace it, saying: **_"Embrace Jesus Christ, and
thinkno more of this world."_** He takes the crucifix and kisses it; but, in kissing it, he trembles
at the remembrance of the many injuries which he has offered to Jesus Christ. He would now
wish to repent sincerely of all his injuries to his Saviour, but he sees that his repentance is
forced by the necessity of his approaching death. **_"He,"_** says St. Augustine, ” **_who is
abandoned by sin before he abandons it, condemns it not freely, but through necessity."_**


7. The common delusion of worldlings is, that earthly things appear great, and that the things
of Heaven, as being distant and uncertain, appear to be of little value. They regard
tribulations as insupportable, and grievous sins as unimportant. The miserable beings are as
if they were shut up in a room filled with smoke, which hinders them from seeing objects
before their eyes. But at the hour of death this darkness shall vanish, and the soul shall begin
to see things in their real colours. At that hour all temporal things appear to be what they
really are vanity, lies, and deception; and the things of eternity assume their true value. Oh!
how important shall judgment, hell, and eternity, which are so much disregarded during life,
appear at the time of death. According as these shall begin to put on their true colours, the
fears of the dying man shall increase. ” **_In morte,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_tanto timor fit acrior,
quanto retributio vicinior; et quanto vicinius judicium tangitur, tanto vehementius
formidator."_** (Mor. 25.) **_The nearer the sentence of the Judge approaches, the more sensible the
fear of condemnation becomes._** Hence the sick man will say: “ **_Oh! in what anguish do I die!
Unhappy me! Oh! that I knew that so unhappy a death awaited me!"_** You have not known;
but you ought to have foreseen it; for you knew that a good death could not be expected after
a wicked life. But, since I must soon die, oh! that I could at least, in the little time that
remains, tranquillize my conscience! Let us pass to the third point.


**_Third Point. Oh! that I could, in the little time that remains, repair the past! But, alas! this
time is not fit for repairing past evils._**


8. The time allowed to careless Christians at the hour of death, is, for two reasons, unfit for
tranquillizing the troubles of their conscience. First, because this time will be very short; for
at the commencement, and for some days during the progress, of the disease, the sick man
thinks only of physicians, of remedies, and of making his last will. During that time his
relatives, friends, and even the physicians deceive him by holding out hopes of recovery.
Hence, deluded by these hopes, he will not be able for some time to persuade himself that his
death is at hand. When shall he begin to persuade himself that death is near? Only when he



shall be at the very point of death. This is the second reason why that time is unfit for
repairing the evils of the soul. At that time the dying man is sick in mind as well as in body.
He shall be assailed by pains in the chest, spasms in the head, debility, and delirium. Those
shall render him unable to make any effort to excite a true detestation of his past sins, or to
apply to the disorders of his past life a remedy which will calm the terrors of his conscience.
The news of his approaching death will astound him to such a degree, that he shall be
scarcely half alive.



9. A person labouring under a severe headache, which deprives him of sleep for two or three
nights, will not even attempt to dictate a letter of ceremony. And at death when he feels but
little, understands but little, and sees only a confusion of things which fills him with terror,
the careless Christian adjusts a conscience burdened with the sins of thirty or forty years.
Then are verified the words of the gospel: ” **_The night cometh when no man worketh."_** (John
ix. 4.) Then his conscience will say to him: ” **_Now thou canst be steward no longer. ”_** (Luke xvi.
2.) There is no more time for negotiation; what has been done, is done**_. ”When distress
cometh upon them, they will seek for peace, and there shall be none. Trouble shall come upon
trouble."_** (Ezech. vii. 25, 26.)


10. It is often said of a person that he led a bad life, but afterwards died a good death; that by
his sighs and tears he gave proofs of sincere repentance. **_"Morientes non delicti pœnitentia_** ,"
says St. Augustine, **_"sed mortis urgentis admonitio compellit."_** (Serm. xxxvi.) **_The wailing of
such persons proceeds not from sorrow for their sins, but from the fear of imminent death. He
was not afraid of sinning, says the holy doctor, but of burning. ”Non meteuit peccare, sed
adere."_** (Epis. cxiv.) Till this moment the dying man has loved sinful objects: will he now
detest them? Perhaps he will then love them with more tenderness; for the objects of our
affections become more dear to us when we are afraid of losing them. The celebrated master
of St. Bruno died with signs of repentance; but when laid in the coffin, he said that he was
damned. If, at the hour of death, even the saints complain that on account of the state of the
head, they can think but little of God, or make but little effort to excite good acts, how can the
negligent Christian make these acts at death, when he was not in the habit of making them
during life? It may be said that he appeared to have a sincere sorrow for the wickedness of
his past life. But, was his sorrow true sorrow? The devil persuades him that the wish to have
sorrow is true sorrow; but he deceives him. The dying man will say: ” **_I am sorry from the
bottom of my heart," etc.;_** but these words shall come from a heart of stone. ” **_From the midst
of the rocks they shall give forth their voices."_** (Ps. ciii. 12.) But he has frequently been at
confession, and has received all the sacraments; he has died in perfect resignation. Ah! the
criminal who goes to be executed, appears to be perfectly resigned: but why? Because he
cannot escape from the officers of justice, who bring him in chains to the place of execution.


11. O moment on which eternity depends! This moment made the saints tremble at the hour
of death, and made them exclaim: ” **_God! where shall I be in a few hours ?"“Sometimes,"_** says
St. Gregory, ” **_the soul even of the just man is disturbed by the terror of vengeance._** (Mor.
xxiv.) "What, then, shall the careless Christian, who has disregarded God, feel when he sees
the scaffold prepared on which he must die? **_“His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he
shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty."_** (Job xxi. 20.) He shall see with his own eyes death
prepared for his soul, and shall from that moment begin to feel the anger of the Lord. The
viaticum which he must receive, the extreme unction which will be administered to him, the



crucifix which is placed in his hands, the recommendation of the soul which is read by the
assisting priest, the lighting of the blessed candle all these shall form the scaffold of divine
justice. The poor sick man perceives that he is already in a cold sweat, that he can no longer
move or speak, that his respiration has begun to fail: in a word, he sees that the moment of
death is at hand; he sees his soul defiled with sins; the Judge waiting for him; hell burning
under his feet; and in this confusion of darkness and terror he shall enter into eternity.


12. ” **_O that they would be wise, and would understand, and would provide for their last
end."_** (Deut. xxxii. 29.) Behold, dearly beloved brethren, how the Holy Ghost exhorts us to
provide now for the terrible straits and distress by which we shall be encompassed at death,
and to adjust at present the accounts which we must render to God; for it will be then
impossible to settle these accounts so as to save our souls**_. My crucified Jesus, I will not wait
till death to embrace thee; I embrace thee at this moment. I love thee above all things; and
because I love thee, I repent with my whole heart of all the offences and insults I have offered
to thee, who art infinite goodness; and I purpose and hope, with thy grace, to love thee
always, and never more to offend thee. Through the merits of thy passion I ask thee to assist
me._**


**SERMON LII. TWENTY-THIRD SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON IMPENITENCE.**
**_" Lord, my daughter is even now dead." MATT. ix. 18._**


How great is God’s goodness! how difficult it is to obtain pardon from a man whom we have
offended! when sinners cast themselves at the feet of the Lord with humility and with sorrow
for having offended him, he instantly pardons and embraces them. ” **_Turn to me, saith the
Lord of Hosts, and I will turn to you. ”_** (Zach. i. 3.) **_Sinners,_** says the Lord, **_I have turned my
back on you, because you first turned your back on me: return to me, and I will return to you
and will embrace you._** When rebuked by the Prophet Nathan, David repented, and said: ” **_I
have sinned against the Lord; I have offended my God."_** David was instantly pardoned: for at
the very moment that he confessed his guilt, Nathan said to him: ”The Lord also hath taken
away thy sin." (2 Kings xii. 13.) But let us come to the gospel of the day, in which we find that
a certain ruler, whose daughter was dead, went immediately to Jesus Christ, and asked him
to restore her to life: ” **_Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her,
and she shall live."_** In explaining this passage, St. Bonaventure turns to the sinner, and says:
” **_Your daughter is your soul; she even now is deadly sin; hasten your conversion. ” Brother,
your soul is your daughter, that has just died by committing sin. Eeturn immediately to God.
Hasten; if you delay, and defer your conversion from day to day, the wrath of God shall
suddenly come upon you, and you shall be cast into hell. ”Delay not to be converted to the
Lord, and defer it not from day to day."_** (Eccl. v. 8, 9.) Behold the sermon for this day, in
which I will show, first, the danger to which he who is in the state of sin, and defers his
conversion, is exposed; and secondly, the remedy to be adopted by him who is in sin, and
wishes to save his soul.


**_First Point. The danger to which a person in sin, who defers his conversion, is exposed._**



1. St. Augustine considers three states of Christians. The first is the state of those who have
always preserved their baptismal innocence; the second is the state of those who have fallen
into sin, and have afterwards returned to God, and persevered in grace; the third is of those
who have fallen and have always relapsed into sin, and are found in that unhappy state at



death. Speaking of the first and second class, he pronounces them secure of salvation; but,
speaking of the third he says: **_"Non dico, non præsumo, non promitto."_** (Hom, xli. int. 50.)” **_I
do not say; I do not presume; I do not promise." He neither says, nor presumes, nor promises,
that such sinners are saved._** From these words it appears that, in his opinion, it is very
improbable that they obtain eternal life. St. Thomas teaches (2, 2, qu. 109, a. 8) **_that he who is
in the state of mortal sin cannot long abstain from the commission of some new sin._** And St.
Gregory says: ” **_A sin which is not blotted out by repentance by its weight soon draws to
another sin; hence it is not only a sin, but the cause of sin."_** (1. 3, Mor. c. ix.) One sin is the
cause of another, because, in the sinner reason is disordered, and inclines him to evil; and
therefore he cannot long resist temptation. ” **_Quando,"_** says St. Anselm, ” **_quis manet in
peccato, ratio jam est deordinata et ideo veniente tentatione faciet id quod est facilius
agere." Hence, according to the holy doctor, though they understand the great advantage of
sanctifying grace, sinners, because they are deprived of grace, always relapse, in spite of all
their efforts to avoid sin. ”Per peccatum non potest prosequi bonum quod cogniscit, conatur
et labitur."_** But how can the branch that is cut off from the vine produce fruit? **_"As,"_** says
Jesus Christ, **_"the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can
you, unless you abide in me."_** (John xv. 4.)



2. But some young persons may say: ” **_I will hereafter give myself to God."_** Behold the false
hope of sinners, which leads them to remain in sin till death, and from death conducts them
to hell! Who are you that say, you will hereafter give yourself to God? But who, I ask,
promises you that you shall have time to give yourself to God, and that you shall not meet
with a sudden death, which will take you out of this world before you give yourself to him?
**_"He,"_** says St. Gregory, ” **_who has promised pardon to penitents has not promised tomorrow
to sinners."_** (Hom. xii. in Ev.) The Lord has promised pardon to all who repent of their sins;
but to those who wish to continue in sin he has not promised time for repentance. Do you
say, hereafter? But Jesus Christ tells you that time is in the hand of God, and not under your
control. ” **_It is not for you to know the times or moments which the Father has put in his own
power."_** (Acts i. 7.) We read in the Gospel of St. Luke, that Jesus Christ, seeing a fig-tree
which was fruitless for three years, ordered it to be cut down. **_"He said to the dresser of the
vineyard: Behold, for these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, and I find none.
Cut it down therefore. Why cumbereth it the ground ?"_** (Luke xiii. 7.) Tell me, you who say
that you will hereafter give yourself to God, for what purpose does he preserve your life? Is it
that you may continue to insult him by sin? No; he gives you life that you may renounce sin,
and change your conduct. ” **_Knowest thou not that the benignity of God leadeth thee to
penance ?"_** (Rom. ii. 4.) But you are resolved not to amend; and if you wish to give yourself to
God only hereafter, he will say of your soul to the dresser of his vineyard: **_"Cut it down. Why
cumbereth it the ground ?"_** Why should such a sinner be allowed to remain on earth? Is it to
continue to offend me? Cat down this fruitless tree, and cast it into the fire. ” **_Every tree,
therefore, that doth not yield good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into the fire."_** (Matt. iii.
10.)


3. But, should God hereafter give you time for repentance, will you, if you do not now repent,
return to him hereafter? Sins, like so many chains, keep the sinner in bondage. ” **_He is first
bound with the ropes of his own sins."_** (Prov. v. 22.) My brother, if you cannot now break the
cords by which you are at present bound, will you be able to break them hereafter, when they
shall be doubled by the commission of new sins? **_To give him an idea of the degree of folly_**



**_which impenitent sinners reach, our Lord showed one day to the Abbot Arsenius, an
Ethiopian, who, not being able to raise a load of faggots, added to their weight, and thus
became less liable to raise it. Sinners, said the Saviour to the holy abbot, act in a similar
manner. They wish to get rid of their past sins, and, at the same time, commit new ones.
These new sins shall lead them into others more numerous and more enormous._** Cain sinned
against his brother, first, by envy; then, by hatred; and afterwards, by murder; finally, he
despaired of the divine mercy, saying: ” **_My iniquity is greater than that I may obtain
pardon."_** (Gen. iv. 13.) Judas also was first guilty of the sin of avarice; he then betrayed Jesus
Christ, and afterwards hanged himself. Sins chain the sinner, and make him their slave, so
that he knowingly brings himself to destruction. ” **_His own iniquities catch the wicked. ”_**
(Prov. v. 22.)



4. Moreover, his sins weigh down the sinner to such a degree, that he no longer regards
heaven nor his own salvation. **_“My iniquities,"_** said David with tears, ” **_are growing over my
head, and, as a heavy burden, are become heavy upon me."_** (Ps. xxxvii. 5.) Hence the
miserable man loses reason, thinks only of earthly goods, and thus forgets the divine
judgments. ” **_And they perverted their own minds, and turned away their eyes, that they
might not look unto heaven, nor remember just judgments."_** (Dan. xiii. 9.) He even hates the
light, because he fears that it will interrupt his criminal pleasures. ” **_Every one that doth evil
hateth the light. ”_** (John iii. 20.) Hence, he becomes miserably blind, and goes round about
continually from sin to sin. ” **_The wicked walk round about."_** (Ps. xi. 9.) He then despises
admonitions, divine calls, hell, heaven, and God. **_"The wicked, when he is come into the
depth of sins, comtemneth."_** (Prov. xviii. 3.)


5. ” **_He hath,"_** says Job, ” **_torn me with wound upon wound, he hath rushed in upon me like a
giant."_** (Job xvi. 15.) By conquering one temptation, a man acquires not only additional
strength to repel future assaults, but also diminishes the power of the devil. And, on the
other hand, when we yield to any temptation, the devil becomes like a giant, and we become
so weak, that we have scarcely strength to resist him any longer. If you receive a wound from
an enemy you lose strength. If to this new wounds be added you shall be exhausted, and
rendered unable to defend yourself. This is what happens to the fools who say: **_"I will here
after give myself to God."_** How can they resist the attacks of the devil, after they have lost
their strength, and after their wounds have mortified?” **_My sores are putrefied and corrupted,
because of my foolishness."_** (Ps. xxxvii. 6.) At its commencement a wound is easily healed;
but when it becomes gangrenous, the cure is most difficult. Recourse must be had to the
cautery; but even this remedy is in many cases ineffectual.


6. But further, St. Paul teaches, that God” **_will have all men to be saved”_** (1 Tim. ii. 4); and that
Jesus Christ came on earth for the salvation of sinners: ” **_Jesus Christ came into this world to
save sinners."_** (1 Tim. i. 15.) God certainly wills the salvation of all who desire it: he wills the
salvation of those who wish to save their souls; but not of those who labour for their own
damnation. Jesus Christ has come to save sinners. To save our souls, two things are
necessary: first, the grace of God; and secondly, your own cooperation. ” **_Behold, I stand at
the gate and knock: if any man shall hear my voice, and open to me the door, I will come
unto him."_** (Apoc. iii. 20.) Then, in order that God may enter into us by his grace, we must, on
our part, ohey his calls, and open our hearts to him. Likewise, St. Paul says, ” **_with fear and
trembling work out your salvation."_** (Phil. ii. 12.) He says, **_work out_**. Then we, too, must co-



operate to our salvation by good works; otherwise the Lord will only give us sufficient grace
by which we shall be able to save our souls, but by which we certainly will not save them.
Behold, the reason: he who is in the state of sin, and continues to commit sin, is daily more
and more attached to the flesh, and more removed from God. Now, how can God, by his
grace, approach to us, when we withdraw farther from him? He then retires from us, and
becomes less liberal of his favours. ” **_And I will make it desolate and I will command the
clouds to rain no rain upon it."_** (Isa. v. 6.) When the soul continues to offend God he
abandons her, and withdraws his helps. Hence she shall cease to feel remorse of conscience;
she shall be left without light; and the blindness of her understanding and the hardness of
her heart shall be increased. She shall become utterly insensible to the calls of God, to the
maxims of faith, and to the melancholy examples of other rebellious souls that have closed
their career in hell.


7 **_"But who knows,"_** the obstinate sinner will say, **_"but God will show me the same mercy
which he has shown to certain great sinners?”_** In answer to this, St. Chrysostom says:
**_"Fortasse dabit, inquis: cur dicis fortasse? Con- tigit aliquando; sed cogita quod de anima
deliberas?"_** (Hom. xxii. in 2 Cor.) You say: ” **_Perhaps God will give me the grace of salvation.
But why do you say perhaps? Is it because he has sometimes given to great sinners the grace
of eternal life? But remember_** , says the holy doctor, **_that there is question of your soul, which,
if once lost, is lost for ever._** I, too, take you up, and admit that God has, by certain
extraordinary graces, saved some enormous sinners. But these cases are very rare; they are
prodigies and miracles of grace, by which God wished to show the boundlessness of his
mercy. But, ordinarily, sinners who wish to continue in sin, are, in the end, cast into hell. On
them are executed the threats of the Lord against obstinate sinners. ” **_You have despised my
counsels, and neglected my reprehensions. I also will laugh in your destruction.... Then they
will call on me, and I will not hear."_** (Prov. i. 25, 26, 28.) I, says the Lord, have called on them
again and again, but they have refused to hear me. ” **_But they did not hear nor incline their
ears; but hardened their neck, that they might not hear me."_** (Jer. xvii. 23.) Now they call
upon me, it is but just that I refuse to listen to their cries. God bears, but he does not bear for
ever; when the time of vengeance arrives he punishes past and present iniquities. ” **_For the
Most High is a patient rewarder."_** (Eccl. v. 4.) And according to St. Augustine, **_the longer God
has waited for negligent sinners the more severely he will chastise them. “Quanto diutius
expectat Deus, ut emenderis; tanto gravius judicabit, si neglexeris."_** (Lib. de util. ag. prcn.)
He who promises to amend, and wilfully neglects to return to God, is unworthy of the grace
of true re
pentance.


**_8 But God is full of mercy. He_** is full of mercy; but he is not so stupid as to act without
reason: to show mercy to those who continue to insult him would be stupidity, and not
goodness. ” **_Is thy eye evil because I am good ?"_** (Matt. xx. 15.) Will you persevere in
wickedness because I am bountiful? God is good, but he is also just, and exhorts us all to
observe his law, if we wish to save our souls. **_"If thou wilt enter into life keep the
commandments."_** (Matt. xix. 17.) Were God to show mercy to the wicked as well as to the
just, and to give to all the grace of conversion before death, he would hold out a strong
temptation even to the saints to commit sin: but, no! when his mercies have reached their
term he punishes, and pardons no more. **_"And my eye shall not spare thee, and I will show
thee no pity."_** (Ezec. vii. 4.) Hence he says: **_Pray that your flight may not be in the winter or_**



**_on the Sabbath."_** (Matt. xxiv. 20.) We are prevented from working in the winter by the cold,
and on the Sabbath by the law. In this passage the Redeemer gives us to understand that, for
impenitent sinners, a time shall come when they would wish to give themselves to God, but
shall find themselves prevented by their bad habits from returning to him. Of this there are
numberless melancholy examples. In his sermons on a happy death, Cataneus relates, that a
dissolute young man, when admonished to give up his wickedness, said: I have a saint who
js omnipotent, and this is the mercy of God. Death came; the unhappy man sent for a
confessor; but while he was preparing for confession, the Devil wrote down before his eyes
all his sins. He was seized with terror, and exclaimed: Alas! what a long catalogue of sins!
And before he was able to make his confession he expired. In his sermons for Sundays
Campadelli relates that a young nobleman addicted to sins of the flesh, was warned by God
and by men to amend his life; but he despised all their admonitions. He afterwards fell into a
severe illness, confessed his sins, and promised to change his life; but, after his recovery, he
returned to the vomit. Behold the vengeance of God! Being one day in a field during the
vintage, he took fever, went home, and feeling that the disease was far advanced, he sent in
haste for a priest who lived near the house. The priest comes, enters the house, salutes the
sick man, but sees a frightful spectacle, the eyes and mouth open, the face black as jet. He
calls the sick man, but finds that he is dead. Dearly beloved brethren, take care that you, too,
be not miserable examples of the justice of God. Give up sin; but give it up from this moment;
for, if you continue to commit sin, the same vengeance which has fallen on so many others
shall also fall on you. Let us come to the remedy.


**_Second Point. The remedy for those who find themselves in sin, and wish to save their souls._**



9. Jesus Christ was one day asked, if the number of the elect is small. ”Lord, are they few that
are saved? But he said to them: Strive to enter by the narrow gate; for many, I say to you,
shall seek to enter, and they shall not be able." (Luke xiii. 23, 24.) He says that many seek to
enter heaven, but do not enter; and why? Because they wish to obtain eternal life without
inconvenience, and without making strong efforts to abstain from forbidden pleasures.
Therefore, he said: "strive to enter at the narrow gate." The gate of heaven is narrow: to enter
it we must labour, and must do violence to ourselves. And we ought to be persuaded that
what we can do Today we shall not be always able to do hereafter. The delay of conversion
sends many Christians to hell: the weakness, darkness, and obduracy of the soul are, as we
have already said, daily increased, and the divine helps are diminished. Thus, the soul shall
die in her sins. You say: I will hereafter return to God. Then you know that, to save your soul,
you must renounce sin why do you not give it up now that God calls you to repentance? If at
some time, says St. Augustine, **_why not now? The time which you now have to repair the
past shall not be given to you hereafter; and the mercy which God shows you at present will
not be extended to you at a future time._** If, then, you wish to save your soul, do immediately
what you must one day do. Go to confession as soon as possible, and tremble lest every delay
may be the eternal ruin of your soul.


10. **_"Nullus,"_** says St. Fulgentius, **_"sub spe misericordiæ debet diutius in peccatis remanere,
cum nolit in corpore sub spe diutius ægrotare."_** (St. Fulg. ad Petr. Diac.) **_Were a physician,
says the saint, to offer you a remedy for sickness, would you say: I do not wish to be cured at
present, because I hope to recover hereafter?_** And when there is a question of the salvation of
your soul, you say: I will remain in sin, because I hope that God will be merciful to me at a



future time. But if, according to his just judgments, the Lord should not show you mercy
hereafter, what shall become of you? shall you not be damned? Let us, says the Apostle, do
good while we have time to do it. **_"Therefore, whilst we have time let us work good to all
men."_** (Gal. vi. 10.) For time may not be given to us to do good hereafter. Hence the Lord
exhorts us to guard our souls with great care; because we know not the hour when he will
come to demand an account of our life. **_"Watch ye, therefore, because you know not the day
nor the hour."_** (Matt. xxv. 18.)



11. **_"My soul is continually in my hands."_** (Ps. cxviii. 109.) He who wears on his finger a ring
containing a diamond of great value, looks frequently at the ring to see if the diamond be
secure: it is thus we ought to watch over our souls. And should we see that it has been lost by
sin, we ought instantly to adopt every means in our power to recover it. We ought to turn
immediately to Jesus, our Saviour, like Magdalene, who, as soon as she knew that he sat at
meat, ran to him, cast herself at his feet, and by her tears obtained pardon. (Luke vii.
37.)” **_Now the axe is laid to the root of the tree."_** (Luke iii. 9.) For all who are found in sin, the
axe of divine justice is at hand to take away their life as soon as the time of vengeance arrives.
Arise, then Christian souls, and if you_are bound by any bad habit, burst your chains, and
remain no longer the slaves of Satan. ” **_Loose the bonds from off thy neck, captive daughter of
Zion."_** (Isa. Hi. 2.) “ **_Posuisti vestigium, ”_** says St. Ambrose, **_"supra voraginem culpao, cito
aufer pedem." You have placed your foot on the mouth of a vortex that is, on sin, which is
the mouth of hell: take away your foot, and retire; otherwise you shall fall into an
unfathomable abyss._**


12. **_I find myself subject to an evil habit._** But, if you wish to give up sin, who can force you to
commit it? All bad habits and all the temptations of hell are overcome by the grace of God.
Recommend yourself to the heart of Jesus Christ, and he will give you grace to conquer all
enemies. But should you be in any proximate occasion of sin you must immediately take it
away, otherwise you shall relapse. ” **_Potius præscinde,"_** says St. Jerome, ” **_quam solve." Do not
wait to loose your bonds gradually; cut them by a single stroke._** The devil seeks to make you
slow in shaking off your fetters. Look for a good confessor; he will tell you what to do. And
should you have the misfortune of falling hereafter into any mortal sin, go immediately to
confession, even on the same day or the same night, if you can. Finally, listen to what I now
say to you: God is ready to assist you: if you wish, it is in your power to save your souls.
Tremble, brethren, lest these words of mine, if you despise them, should be for you so many
swords in hell for all eternity.


**SERMON LIII. TWENTY-FOURTH SUNDAY AFTER PENTECOST. - ON BLASPHEMY.**
**_"When, therefore, you shall see the abomination of desolation." MATT. xxiv. 15._**


ALL sins are hateful in the sight of God; but the sin of blasphemy ought more properly to be
called an abomination to the Lord. Every mortal sin, as the Apostle says, dishonours God.
” **_By transgression of the law, thou dishonourest God."_** (Rom. ii. 23.) Other sins dishonour
God indirectly by the violation of his law; but blasphemy dishonours him directly by the
profanation of his most holy name. Hence St. Chrysostom teaches, that no sin exasperates the
Lord so much as the sin of blasphemy against his adorable name. ” **_Nihil ita exacerbat Deum,
sicut quando nomen ejus blasphematur."_** Dearly beloved Christians, allow me, then, this day,



to show you, first, the great enormity of the sin of blasphemy; and secondly, the great rigour
with which God punishes it.


**_First Point. On the great enormity of the sin of blasphemy._**



1. What is blasphemy? It is the uttering of language injurious to God; it is, according to the
definition of theologians, **_"contumeliosa in Deum locutio ;"_** or, **_contumely against God._** God!
whom does man assail when he blasphemes? He directly attacks the Lord. **_"He hath
strengthened himself against the Almighty."_** (Job. xv. 25.) Are you not afraid, blasphemer,
says St. Ephrem, **_that fire will come down from heaven and devour you? or that the earth
shall open and swallow you up?”Non metuis ne forte ignis de cœlo descendat et devoret te,
qui sic os adversus omnipotentem aperis? Neque vereris, ne terra te ab-
sorbeat?"_** (Paren. 3.) **_The devil,_** says St. Gregory Nazianzen, **_trembles at the name of Jesus:
and we are not afraid to profane it. ”Domones ad Christi nomen exhorrescunt, nos vero
nomen adeo venerandum contumelia afficere nou veremur."_** (Orat. xx.) The vindictive assail a
man who is their own equal; but, by their blasphemies blasphemers appear to seek revenge
against God, who does or permits what is displeasing to them. There is a great difference
between an act of contempt towards the portrait of a king, and an insult offered to his person.
Man is the image of God; but the blasphemer offends God himself. ” **_He who blasphemes”_**
says St. Athanasius, ” **_acts against the very Deity itself."_** The man who violates the law is
guilty of a crime; but he who attacks the person of his sovereign commits an act of treason;
therefore he receives no mercy, but is chastised with the utmost severity. What, then, shall we
say of the man who blasphemes and insults the majesty of God?” **_If,"_** says the high-priest
Heli, **_"one man shall sin against another, God may be appeased in his behalf; but if a man
shall sin against the Lord, who shall pray for him?”_** (1 Kings ii. 25.) The sin of blasphemy,
then, is so enormous, that the saints themselves appear not to have courage to pray for a
blasphemer.


2. Some sacrilegious tongues blaspheme the God who preserves their existence!” **_Tu Deo
benefacienti tibi," says St. Chrysostom, ”et tui curam agenti maledicis."_** O God! you stand
with one foot at the gate of hell; and if God, in his mercy, did not preserve your life you
should be damned for ever: and, instead of thanking him for his goodness, you, at the very
time that he bestows his favours upon you, blaspheme his holy name. ” **_If,"_** says the Lord,
” **_my enemy hath reviled me, I would verily have borne with it._** (Ps. liv. 13.) Had you treated
me with contumely and insult at the time that I chastised you, I would be more willing to
bear with your impiety; but you revile me at the time that I confer my favours upon you.
diabolical tongue! exclaims St. Bernardine of Sienna, **_what could have induced you to
blaspheme your God, who has created you, and redeemed you with his blood? "0 lingua
diabolica, quid, potest te inducere ad blasphemandum Deus tuum qui te plasmavit, qui te
pretioso sanguine redemit?"_** (Serm. xxxiii.) Some expressly blaspheme the name of Jesus
Christ of that God who died on a cross for the love of them. God! if we were not subject to
death, we should be glad to die for Jesus Christ, in order to make some little return of
gratitude to a God who gave his life for us. I say, a little return of gratitude; for there is no
comparison between the death of a miserable creature, and the death of a God. But instead of
loving and blessing this God, you, as St. Augustine says, revile and curse him. ” **_Christ was
scourged by the lash of the Jews; but he is not less scourged by the blasphemies of false
Christians."_** (S. Aug. in Joan.) Some have blasphemed and insulted the Virgin Mary, that



good mother, who loves us so tenderly, and prays continually for us. Some of these
blasphemers have received a horrible chastisement from God. Surius relates, in the 7th
August, that a certain impious Christian blasphemed the blessed Virgin, and pierced her
image with a dagger. As soon as he went out of the church to which the image belonged, he
was struck by a thunderbolt, and reduced to ashes. The infamous Nestorious blasphemed,
and induced others to blaspheme, most holy Mary, by asserting that she was not the mother
of God. But, before death, his impious tongue was eaten away by worms, and he died in
despair.



3. **_"Who is this who speaketh blasphemies?"_** (Luke v. 21.) He is a Christian who has received
the holy sacrament of baptism, in which his tongue has been in a certain manner consecrated
to God. **_A learned author says, that on the tongue of all who are baptized is placed blessed
salt, ”that the tongues of Christians may be made, as it were, sacred, and may be accustomed
to bless God."_** (Clericat. torn. 1. Dec. Tract. 52.) And the blasphemer afterwards makes his
tongue, as St. Bernardine says, **_a sword to pierce the heart of God. “Lingua blasphemantis
efficitur quasi gladius cor Dei penetrans."_** (Tom. 4. serm. xxxiii.) Hence the saint adds **_that no
sin contains in itself so much malice as the sin of blasphemy. ”Nullum est peccatum quod
habet in se tantem iniquitatem sicut blasphemia."_** St. Chrysostom says, that” **_there is no sin
worse than blasphemy; for in it is the accumulation of all evils, and every punishment."_** St.
Jerome teaches the same doctrine. ” **_Nothing,"_** says the holy doctor, ” **_is more horrible than
blasphemy; for every sin, compared with blasphemy, is small."_** (In Isa. cxviii.) And here it is
necessary to observe, that blasphemies against the saints, against holy things or holidays
such as the sacraments, the Mass, Easter Sunday, Christmas Day, Holy Saturday are of the
same species as blasphemies against God; for St. Thomas teaches, that, as the honour paid to
the saints, to holy things, and holidays, is referred to God, so an insult offered to the saints is
injurious to God, who is the foundation of sanctity. ”Sicut Deus, in sanctis suis laudatur," as
we read in the 150th Psalm, "laudate Dominum in sanctis ejus, ita et blasphemia in sanctos in
Deum redundat." (S. Thorn, qu. 13, a 1 3, a 1, ad 2.) The saint adds, that blasphemy is one of
the greatest of the sins against religion. (Ibid. a. 3.)


4. Thus, from the works of St. Jerome we may infer, that blasphemy is more grievous than
theft, than adultery, or murder. All other sins, says St. Bernardine proceeds from frailty or
ignorance; but the sin of blasphemy proceeds from malice. ” **_Omnia alia peccata vindentur
procedere partim ex fragilitate, partim ex ignorantia, sed peccatum blasphemia procedit ex
propria malitia."_** (Cic. serm. xxx.) For it proceeds from a bad will, and from a certain hatred
conceived against God. Hence the blasphemer renders himself like the damned, who, as St.
Thomas says, do not now blaspheme with the mouth for they have no body, but with the
heart, cursing the divine justice which punishes them. ” **_The detestation of the divine justice
is in them an interior blasphemy of the heart."_** (S. Thom. 2, 2, qu. 13, a. 4.) The saint adds,
**_that we may believe that as the saints in heaven, after the resurrection shall praise God with
the tongue, so the reprobates in hell shall also blaspheme him with the tongue. ”Et credibile
est quod post resurrectionem erit in eis etiam vocalis blasphemiæ sicut in sanctis vocalis
laus Dei."_** Justly, then, has a learned author **_called blasphemy the language of hell; because,
as God speaks by the mouth of the saints so the devil speaks by the mouth of blasphemers.
”Blasphemia est peccatum diabolicum, loquela infernalis: sicut enim Spiritus Sanctus
loquitur per bonos ita et diabolus per blasphemos." (_** Mansi. Discors, 7, num. 2.) When St.
Peter denied Christ in the Palace of Pilate, and swore that he did not know him, the Jews



said, that his language showed that he was a disciple of Jesus, because he spoke the language
of his Master. ” **_Surely,"_** they said, **_"thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth
discover thee."_** (Matt. xxvi. 73.) Thus we may say to every blasphemer: You are from hell; you
are a true disciple of Lucifer; for you speak the language of the damned. St. Antonine writes,
**_that the entire occupation of the damned in hell consists in blaspheming and cursing God.
”Non aliud apus inferno exercent nisi blasphemare Deum et maledicere."_** (Part 2, tit. 7, cap.
iii.) In proof of this doctrine the **_saint adduces the following text of the Apocalypse: ”And
they gnawed their tongues for pain: and they blasphemed the God of heaven."_** (Apoc. xvi. 10,
11.) The holy doctor afterwards adds, **_that he who indulges in the vice of blasphemy, already
belongs to the number of the damned, because he practises their art. ”Qui ergo hoc vitio
detinetur ostendit se pertinere ad statum damnatorum, ex quo exercet artem eorum."_** (Ibid.)



5. To the malice of blasphemy is added the malice of scandal, which generally accompanies
blasphemy; for this sin is ordinarily committed externally and in presence of others. St. Paul
reproved the Jews, because by their sins they caused the Gentiles to blaspheme our God, and
to laugh at his law. **_"For the name of God, through you, is blasphemed by the Gentiles."_**
(Rom. ii. 24.) But how much more criminal are Christians, who, by their blasphemies, induce
other Christians to imitate their example! How does it happen, that in certain provinces
blasphemies are never, or at least very seldom, heard, and that in other places this horrible
vice is so prevalent, that the Lord may say of them: ” **_My name is continually blasphemed all
the day long."_** (Isa. Iii, 5.) In the squares, houses, cities, villas, nothing is heard but
blasphemies. How does this happen? Some of the inhabitants learn to blaspheme from
others: children from their parents, servants from their masters, the young from the old. In
some families particularly the vice of blasphemy seems to be transmitted as an inheritance.
The father is a blasphemer; hence, the sons and nephews blaspheme: to this inheritance their
descendants succeed. O accursed father! Instead of instructing your children to bless the
name of God, you teach them to blaspheme him and his saint. ” **_But I reprove them when they
blaspheme in my presence."_** Of what use are these reproofs, when with your own mouth you
give them bad example. For God’s sake, for God’s sake, O fathers of families, never
blaspheme; but be particularly on your guard never to blaspheme in presence of your
children. This is a crime which God can no longer bear in you. And whenever you hear any
of your children utter a blasphemy, reprove them severely, and, in obedience to the advice of
St. Chrysostom, **_strike him on the mouth, and you shall thus sanctify your hand. ”Contere os
ipsius, manum tuam percussione sanctificat."_** (Hom. i. ad pop.) Certain fathers unmercifully
beat a child for the neglect of some temporal business; but if he blaspheme the saints, they
either laugh at his blasphemies, or listen to them in silence. St. Gregory relates (Dial. 4., cap.
xvii.), **_that a child of five years, the son of a Roman noble man, was in the habit of profaning
the name of God. The father neglected to correct him; but he one day saw his son pursued by
certain black men. The child ran to embrace his father; but they, who were so many devils,
killed him in the father‟s arms, and carried him with them to hell._**


**_Second Point. On the great rigour with which God punishes the sin of blasphemy._**


6. **_"Woe to the sinful nation... they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel."_** (Isa. i. 4.) Woe
to blasphemers, eternal woe to them: for, according to Tobias, they shall be condemned**_.
”They shall be condemned that blaspheme thee."_** (Job xiii. 16.) The Lord has said by the
mouth of Job, **_"Thou imitatest the tongue of blasphemers; thy own mouth shall condemn, and_**



**_not I."_** (Job xv. 5, 6.) In pronouncing the sentence of their condemnation, God will say: It is
not I that condemn you to hell; it is your own mouth, with which you have dared to revile me
and .my saints, that condemns you. Poor miserable blasphemers! They shall continue to
blaspheme in hell for their greater torment: their very blasphemies in hell shall always
remind them that they are damned for ever in punishment of their blasphemies on earth.



7. But blasphemers are punished not only in hell, but even on this earth. In the Old Law they
were stoned by the people. **_"And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him
die; all the multitude shall stone him."_** (Lev. xxiv. 76.) In the New Law they were condemned
to death by the Emperor Justinian. St. Louis, King of France, ordered them to be punished by
perforating their tongue, and by branding their forehead with a red hot iron; and when they
afterwards relapsed into blasphemy, he ordained that they should die on the scaffold. (Homo
Bon. de cas. res. p. 2, c. i.) Another author says, that **_the law renders blasphemers (as being
infamous) incapable of giving testimony._** (Navarr. cons. 11, de offic. ord.) By the constitution
of Gregory the Fourteenth **_, they were deprived of Christian burial._** In the **_Authentica ut non
luxur hom._** , **_it is said that blasphemies bring on famine, earthquakes, and pestilence. ”Propter
blasphemias, et fames, et terræmotus et pestilentia fiunt."_** You, O blasphemer, complain that
though you labour and submit to fatigue, you are always in poverty. You say: ” **_I know not
why I am always in misery: some malediction must have fallen on my family."_** No; the
blasphemies which you utter are the cause of your wretchedness, and make you always an
object of God’s malediction.


8. O! how many melancholy examples could I mention of blasphemers who have died a bad
death. Father Segneri relates, (Tom. 1, Rag. 8,) that, in Gascony, two men who had
blasphemed the blood of Jesus Christ, were soon after killed in a quarrel, and torn to pieces
by dogs. In Mexico, a blasphemer being once reproved, answered: ” **_I will hereafter
blaspheme more than I have hitherto done."_** During the night he found his tongue sowed
under the palate, and died in that miserable state without giving the least sign of repentance.
Dresselius relates, that a certain person was struck blind in the very act of blaspheming.
Another, in uttering a blasphemy against St. Anthony, was seized by a flame which issued
from the image of the saint, and was burnt alive. In his book against blasphemy, Sarnelli
relates, that in Constantinople, a man called Simon Tornaco, who had blasphemed God,
began like a mad dog to lacerate his own flesh, and died in his madness. Canta- pratensis
states (cap. xlviii.), that a person who had been guilty of blasphemy, had his eyes distorted,
and that falling on the ground he bellowed like an ox, and con tinued to roar aloud until he
expired. In the Gallician Mercury (lib. x.) we read that a man named Michael, who had been
condemned to be hanged, when he felt the pain of the halter, burst out into blasphemies, and
died instantly. After death his head fell from the body, and the tongue remined hanging out
from the neck, as black as coal. I abstain from fatiguing you with other terrible examples: you
can find a great many of them in the work of Father Sarnelli against blasphemy.


9. But to conclude. Tell me, blasphemers, if there be any of you present, what benefit do you
derive from your accursed blasphemies? You do not receive pleasure from them. Bellarmine
says, **_that blasphemy is a sin which produces no pleasure._** You derive no profit from them;
for, as I have already said, your blasphemies are the cause of your poverty and wretchedness.
You derive no honour from them; your fellow- blasphemers have a horror of your
blasphemies, and call you a mouth of hell. Tell me, then, why you blaspheme. **_"Father, the_**



**_habit which I have contracted is the cause of my blasphemies."_** But can this habit excuse you
before God? If a son beat his father, and say to him: ” **_My father, have compassion on me: for I
have contracted a habit of beating you :"_** would the father take pity on him? You say that
you blaspheme through the anger caused by your children, your wife, or your master. Your
wife or your master put you into a passion, and you take revenge on the saints. What injury
have the saints done to you? They intercede before God in your behalf, and you blaspheme
them. But” **_the devil tempts me at that time."_** If the devil tempts you, follow the example of a
certain young man, who, when tempted to blaspheme, went for advice to the Abbot Pemene.
The abbot told him, that as often as the devil tempted him to commit this sin, his answer
should be: Why should I blaspheme that God who has created me, and bestowed so many
benefits upon me? I will forever praise and bless him. The young man followed the advice,
and Satan ceased to tempt him. When you are excited to anger, can you speak nothing but
blasphemies? Say on such occasions: **_"Accursed sin, I hate thee: Lord, assist me: Mary, obtain
for me the gift of patience."_** And if you have hitherto contracted the abominable habit of
blaspheming, renew every morning, as soon as you rise, the resolution of doing violence to
yourself to abstain from all blasphemies during the day: and then say three Aves to most
holy Mary, that she may obtain for you the grace to resist every temptation by which you
shall be assailed. 


THE END.
