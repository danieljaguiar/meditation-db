# 2. Meditation

a) Try to immerse yourself in the truths presented, know what you lack, and compare your behavior with that of Jesus and the Saints.
b) Healthy affections will be the natural consequence of the preceding exercise; repent of the past, aspire to this or that virtue, increase the justified fear of hell, the desire for heaven and confidence in Divine Mercy. It is useful to dwell on these affections.
c) Make few, but well determined purposes.

## 3. The Conclusion

a) Thank God, who has deigned to speak to your heart.
b) Offer Him your life, body and soul.
c) Ask for their help to carry out the purposes and implore the intercession of Our Lady, the Guardian Angel and the Saints.

Meditate, and you will live!
