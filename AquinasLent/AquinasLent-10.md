_Think diligently upon him that endured such opposition from sinners against himself; that you be not wearied, fainting in your minds._ â€” Hebrews xii. 3.

1\. We are advised to _think diligently_ that is, to think upon Him over and over again. _In all thy ways_, says Holy Scripture, _think upon him_ ([Prov. iii, 6](https://vulgata.online/bible/Prov.iii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Prov.iii.6:vs)). The reason for which is that no matter what anxiety may befall us, we have a remedy in the cross.

For there we find obedience to God. _He humbled himself becoming obedient_, says St. Paul ([Phil. ii, 8](https://vulgata.online/bible/Phil.ii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Phil.ii.8:vs)). Likewise, we find a loving forethought for those akin to him, shown in the care he had, when upon the very cross, for his mother. We find, too, charity for his fellows, for on the cross he prayed for sinners, _Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do_ ([Lc. xxiii, 34](https://vulgata.online/bible/Lc.xxiii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Lc.xxiii.34:vs)). He showed, also, patience in suffering, I _was dumb and was humbled, and kept silence from good things: and my sorrow was renewed_ (Ps. xxxviii. 3). Finally he showed, in all things, a perseverance to the end, for he persevered until death itself. _Father, into thy bands I commend my spirit_ ([Lc. xxiii, 46](https://vulgata.online/bible/Lc.xxiii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Lc.xxiii.46:vs)).

So on the cross we find an example of all the virtues. As St. Augustine says, the cross was not only the gallows where Our Lord suffered in patience, it was a pulpit from which he taught mankind.

2\. But what is it that we are t*o think*, over and over again? Three things:

- (i) The kind of Passion it was. _He endured opposition_, that is, suffering from spoken words. For instance they said, _Vah, though that destroyest the temple of God_ ([Mt. xxvii, 40](https://vulgata.online/bible/Mt.xxvii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Mt.xxvii.40:vs)). It is said in the Psalms ([Ps. xvii, 44](https://vulgata.online/bible/Ps.xvii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Ps.xvii.44:vs), _Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people_, and it was foretold that Our Lord should be, _A sign which shall be contradicted_ ([Lc. ii, 34](https://vulgata.online/bible/Lc.ii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Lc.ii.34:vs)). St. Paul, in the text, says such opposition, meaning so grievous and so humiliating an opposition. _0 all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow_ (Lamentations i. 12).

- (ii) From whom He suffered the Passion. It was from sinners, from those for whom He was suffering. _Christ died once for our sins, the just for the unjust_ ([OnePet. iii, 18](https://vulgata.online/bible/OnePet.iii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.OnePet.iii.18:vs)).

- (iii) Who it was that suffered. Before the Passion, from the beginning of the world he had suffered in his members, but in the Passion He suffered in his own person. Whence the words _against himself_. _Who his own self_, says St. Peter ([OnePet. ii, 24](https://vulgata.online/bible/OnePet.ii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.OnePet.ii.24:vs), _bore our sins in his body upon the tree_.

3\. To _think diligently_ upon Our Lord's Passion is a very profitable employment, which is why St. Paul adds _that you be not wearied fainting in your minds_. The Passion of Christ keeps us from fainting. St. Gregory says, "If we recall the Passion of Christ, nothing seems so hard that it cannot be borne with equanimity." You will not then fail, worn out in spirit, in loyalty to the true faith, nor in the prosecution of good works.

St. Paul again gives a reason for our courageous perseverance when he says, in the following verse, _You have not yet resisted unto blood_ ([Heb. xii, 4](https://vulgata.online/bible/Heb.xii?ed=DR2&vfn=DR2.Heb.xii.4:vs)). As though he said, "You must not faint at these anxieties your own troubles cause you. You have not yet borne as much as Christ. For He indeed shed his blood for us."

(In Heb. xii.)
